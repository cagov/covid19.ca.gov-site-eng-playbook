Content creators need to be free to update content on their own and engineers need to be able to ensure adherence to performance and usability standards. A content management system (CMS) is the solution to keep all that balanced. Most CMS solutions rely on an application server that reads content data from a database. The content data is created by content creators through editing pages, then the content consumers use a portal to view the finished product. The portal serves the content with the appropriate headers and style information.

For covid19.ca.gov, CMS tools are not ideal from an engineering standpoint. The scale of the web traffic going through a single server would create scalability problems.  We need the content to deliver fast and allow for caching wherever applicable. Static content through a content delivery network (CDN) is the best solution for large audiences. While a static site is the best for performance, itâ€™s not ideal for content creators. Maintaining headers, footers, styles, images, links, Javascript, and everything else the public would expect in a good website is impossible to maintain without automation. We need something in between.

We use WordPress to edit and mantain our content. WordPress is one of the most popular CMS tools in the world. It has excellent editing features, numerous third party plugins, and plenty of support. Its visual editing features out-of-the-box are perfect for most users.

We do **not** use WordPress to deploy our content. We have a custom service for deploying content. The architecture is Node.JS function-asaa-service (FAAS) in Azure. Content editors in WordPress create WordPress Posts with the content to be deployed. WordPress pings the custom service when content is changed. The service downloads all the content from WordPress through the WordPress API. The service compares the content to the deployed 11ty snippets i github and then updates pages that changed. The 11ty build turns those snippets into a static website and then the github/Azure pipeline deploys the static site to production. The service also sends pings to the translation service when translation tagged content is changed so they can include translated content in future updates.
