[Airtable](https://airtable.com) is a flexible and easy-to-use collaborative spreadsheet. We have an Airtable base that we use to track and manage industry guidance PDFs across multiple government agencies. Data is shared as synced views with the Department of Labor, California Department of Public Health, and Governor's Office of Business and Economic Development and is shared with covid19.ca.gov & Storybook via our API base.
