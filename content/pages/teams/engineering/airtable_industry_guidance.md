[Airtable](https://airtable.com) is a flexible and easy-to-use collaborative spreadsheet. 

We have an Airtable base that we use to track and manage State industry guidance PDFs across multiple government agencies.

Data is shared as synced views with the Labor Agency, CDPH, GO-Biz and will be shared covid19.ca.gov & Storybook via our API Base.
