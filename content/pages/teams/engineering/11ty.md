The Covid site uses Eleventy ([11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/)) for static site generation (SSG). During the site build, 11ty reads HTML snippets to merge content with functional components into complete HTML pages.  The HTML pages are then ready to be deployed as a complete static website that requires no server processing to be consumed by the end user.  We can use any web platform to host the website.

## Sample page snippet ##

```nunjucks

layout: "page.njk"
title: "Title for the page"
meta: "Long decription that will appear in the page meta [&hellip;]"
