Some kinds of links on our site have been engineered to have an icon appear after the link automatically. This formatting increases accessibility and benefits all users by letting them know what kind of link it is before they click it.

No additional code or classes need to be added to these links to get the standard formatting.

## External links

Links that go to any domain that is not **covid19.ca.gov** will automatically get an external link icon when published.

## PDF links

Links that connect to a PDF will automatically get a PDF icon when published.

## What if a link is both external and to a PDF?

Each formatted link will only get one icon, and PDF icons take precedence over external link icons. A PDF link that goes to another domain will only get the PDF icon.
