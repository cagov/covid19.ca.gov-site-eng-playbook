# Two-factor authentication

We recommend enabling **two-factor authentication** on your account to keep it secure. This means you will use your password and another method to enter WordPress.

### Setup

1. Log in to your account.
2. Select **Profile**.
3. Scroll down to *Two-Factor Options*.
4. Select your preferred option for receiving your code by checking **Enabled** and **Primary**.
5. Select **Update profile** at the bottom of the page to save your two-factor authentication method.

Email is the simplest option.

Allow 15 minutes to set up two-factor authentication with an app (like Google Authenticator or Microsoft Authenticator) through Time Based One-Time Password. Itâ€™s more involved.
