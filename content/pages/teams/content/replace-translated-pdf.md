To replace a translated PDF and have it link to its appropriate translated page, follow these steps.

1. Go to https://github.com/cagov/covid-static.
2. Select the **pdf** folder.
3. In the upper-right corner, select the **Add file** button.
4. Select **Upload files** from the dropdown menu.
5. Upload your file by dragging it into the _Drag files here to add them to your repository_ box or selecting **choose your files** and using the popup window. You can attach multiple files if you want to upload all translated guidances at one time. **Do not upload the EN PDF** as it will replace the currently posted English PDF which may be more recent than the translated pdfs received.
6. In the _Commit changes_ section, enter brief details (less than 50 characters) about what you're doing in the first line that contains the placeholder text _Add files via upload_.
  a. For example, "replacing-translated-guidance-hair-salons-13" with 13 indicating that all 13 translations are being replaced by this upload).

  c. If you have more information to add, put them in the larger box with the placeholder text _Add an optional extended description_.
7. Select the green **Commit changes** button to submit the PDF for upload.
8. To track the status of the PDF upload, select **Actions** in the menu at the top of the page.

  b. When a green check mark appears to the left of this text, the PDFs have been uploaded (~1 min).
