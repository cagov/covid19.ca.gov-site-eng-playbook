The covid19.ca.gov homepage is maintained through several fragments rather than one post. These include:

* The [banner and recent updates sections](https://cagov.github.io/covid19.ca.gov-site-eng-playbook/teams/content/banner.html)
* The [video section](https://cagov.github.io/covid19.ca.gov-site-eng-playbook/teams/content/video.html)
* [People want to know](https://as-go-covid19-d-001.azurewebsites.net/wp-admin/post.php?post=5143&action=edit) 
* [The site menu/navigation](https://as-go-covid19-d-001.azurewebsites.net/wp-admin/post.php?post=7484&action=edit)

Other pieces are edited directly through [github](https://github.com/cagov/covid19/tree/master/pages/manual-content/homepages).
