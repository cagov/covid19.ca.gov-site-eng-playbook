When using images in page content, it's important to stick to certain standards to maintain a consistent look and feel sitewide. We consider:

* Aesthetics and style
* When to use images
* Writing captions
* How to add images
* Size and resolution
* HTML for responsive images

## Aesthetics and style

* For photos, the design team recommends image be the full width of the page, be centered, and have a 5x3 aspect ratio.
* Illustrations/graphics should be inline (to the right or left of text) or centered. Centered images should be full width, but inline images can be smaller.

## When to use images

## Writing captions

## How to add images

* Resize and compress with Squoosh (or other tool of choice)
* Upload to Github
* Add to page in WordPress
* Use classes in WordPress to define desktop and mobile images

## Size and resolution concerns 

(Including accessibility through performance)

### Filesize

The file size should be as small as possible without looking like quality is being lost. Anything less than 500KB in size is OK. 

### Image dimensions

* Desktop width: 920px
* Mobile width: 325px

## HTML options for sharing responsive images

* Use the ["picture"](https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/quick-tip-how-to-use-html5-picture-for-responsive-images--cms-21015) tag. This needs a fallback for IE, but the format accepts multiple sizes.
* Bootstrapâ€™s [.img-fluid tag reference](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/content/images/)
