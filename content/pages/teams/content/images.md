When using images in page content, it's important to stick to certain standards to maintain a consistent look and feel sitewide. Addressed here:

* Aesthetics and style
* When to use images
* Writing captions
* Steps to adding images
* Size and resolution
* HTML for responsive images

## Aesthetics and style

* For photos, our designer recommends image be full width of the page, centered, at 5x3 aspect ratio
* Illustrations/graphics should be inline (to the right or left of text) or centered. Centered images should be full width, but inline images can be smaller.

## When to use images

## Writing captions

(Advice on writing captions)

## Steps to adding images

* Resize and compress with Squoosh (or other tool of choice)
* Upload to Github
* Add to page in WordPress
* Use classes in WordPress to define desktop and mobile images

## Size and resolution concerns 

(Including accessibility through performance)

* Filesize: 
** Should be as small as possible without looking like quality is being lost. Anything less than 500KB in size is OK. 

* Image dimensions:
** Desktop Width: 920px
** Mobile Width: 325px

## HTML options for sharing responsive images

* Using "<picture />" (but needs a fallback for IE) (this format accepts multiple sizes) https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/quick-tip-how-to-use-html5-picture-for-responsive-images--cms-21015
* Bootstrapâ€™s .img-fluid tag reference: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/content/images/
