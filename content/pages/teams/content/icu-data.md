The Regional Stay Home Order is no longer in effect. As a result, the parts of this process related to regions moving in and out of the Order are no longer being performed.

## Daily postings of ICU actual regional data

* Daily ICU regional data should be available by 7:00 p.m. the night before it is posted. Data will be included in the daily GO report and then messaged up to GO/CHHS. 
* Publication on COVID19 website by 12:00 pm daily (the next day). Reflected simultaneously on the CDPH site as a link.
 
## Day of announcement
* The covid19.ca.gov website team is notified/confirms by 8 am that a region is under a SAHO to make changes on their map.
  * Confirmation would hopefully come the night before through the data.
* Example of timing of order
  * Post at 12:00 pm Saturday
  * Regional Stay Home Order effective 11:59pm Sunday (one day after posted)
* Posting on covid19 website occurs as planned by 12:00 pm.
 
## Blueprint

* Blueprint data: Weekly, same cadence as before (embargoed notification to LHDs on Monday, posted by 12pm Tuesday).
* Regular Blueprint rules apply with tier movement.
* Run data and post as regular.
* Allow county moves to a less restrictive tier if not under Regional Stay Home Order.
  * A county cannot move if it is in a region in which there is a Regional Stay Home Order.
