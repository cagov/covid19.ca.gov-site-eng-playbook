Broadly speaking, the content team:

* Takes information about policies, programs, and the pandemic and puts it into language everyday Californians can understand
* Applies content design principles to make information easy to find and understand
* Collaborates with researchers to understand people's needs and designers to create visual arrangements that compliment the words on the page

## What's in this guide

Almost all content is managed through [WordPress](https://as-go-covid19-d-001.azurewebsites.net/wp-login.php). Thanks to the development team (using rad ideas from our [Research, Analytics, and Design (RAD) teams](https://cagov.github.io/covid19.ca.gov-site-eng-playbook/teams/rad/)) we've got a lot of custom elements we can use to create a great digital experience. General info about [editing content](https://cagov.github.io/covid19.ca.gov-site-eng-playbook/teams/content/editing.html), including handy [code snippets](https://cagov.github.io/covid19.ca.gov-site-eng-playbook/teams/content/code-snippets.html), is a good place to start.

We host images and files, like PDFs, through [github](https://github.com/cagov/covid19).

* You can [upload files](https://cagov.github.io/covid19.ca.gov-site-eng-playbook/teams/content/uploading.html) like:
  * [Images](https://cagov.github.io/covid19.ca.gov-site-eng-playbook/teams/content/upload-image.html)
  * PDFs, including [replacing them](https://cagov.github.io/covid19.ca.gov-site-eng-playbook/teams/content/replace-pdf.html), [replacing translated PDFs](https://cagov.github.io/covid19.ca.gov-site-eng-playbook/teams/content/replace-translated-pdf.html), and [updating the Industry guidance in other languages page](https://cagov.github.io/covid19.ca.gov-site-eng-playbook/teams/content/ig-other-languages.html)

Some content in WordPress requires working in custom solutions created by the [engineering team](https://teamdocs.covid19.ca.gov/teams/engineering/).

* We have several [custom widgets and pages](https://cagov.github.io/covid19.ca.gov-site-eng-playbook/teams/content/backend.html), including:
  * [Redirects](https://cagov.github.io/covid19.ca.gov-site-eng-playbook/teams/content/redirects.html)
  * Updating the [homepage](https://cagov.github.io/covid19.ca.gov-site-eng-playbook/teams/content/homepage.html), incuding the [banner](https://cagov.github.io/covid19.ca.gov-site-eng-playbook/teams/content/banner.html) and [video](https://cagov.github.io/covid19.ca.gov-site-eng-playbook/teams/content/video.html)
  * Updating the [Blueprint for a Safer Economy](https://cagov.github.io/covid19.ca.gov-site-eng-playbook/teams/content/blueprint.html), including the [what's open data](https://cagov.github.io/covid19.ca.gov-site-eng-playbook/teams/content/whats-open.html) and [county map dates](https://cagov.github.io/covid19.ca.gov-site-eng-playbook/teams/content/map-dates.html)
  * Updating [ICU data](https://cagov.github.io/covid19.ca.gov-site-eng-playbook/teams/content/icu-data.html)
