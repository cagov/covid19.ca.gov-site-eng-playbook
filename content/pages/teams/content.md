Most content is managed through [WordPress](https://as-go-covid19-d-001.azurewebsites.net/wp-login.php). Thanks to the development team (using rad ideas from our [Research, Analytics, and Design (RAD) teams](https://cagov.github.io/covid19.ca.gov-site-eng-playbook/teams/rad/)) we've got a lot of custom elements we can use to create a great digital experience.
