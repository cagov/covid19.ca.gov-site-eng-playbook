The content team's primary responsibilities are to:

* Take information about policies, programs, and the pandemic and puts it into language everyday Californians can understand
* Apply content design principles to make information easy to find and understand
* Collaborate with researchers to understand people's needs and designers to create visual arrangements that complement the words on the page

## How we do it

Almost all content is managed through [WordPress](https://as-go-covid19-d-001.azurewebsites.net/wp-login.php). Thanks to the engineering team(https://teamdocs.covid19.ca.gov/teams/engineering/) (using rad ideas from our [research, analytics, and design (RAD) teams](https://cagov.github.io/covid19.ca.gov-site-eng-playbook/teams/rad/)) we've got a lot of custom elements we can use to create a great digital experience. General info about [editing content](https://cagov.github.io/covid19.ca.gov-site-eng-playbook/teams/content/editing.html), including handy [code snippets](https://cagov.github.io/covid19.ca.gov-site-eng-playbook/teams/content/code-snippets.html), is a good place to start.

We host images and files, like PDFs, through [GitHub](https://github.com/cagov/covid19).

You can [upload files](https://cagov.github.io/covid19.ca.gov-site-eng-playbook/teams/content/uploading.html) like:

* [Images](https://cagov.github.io/covid19.ca.gov-site-eng-playbook/teams/content/upload-image.html)
* PDFs, including [replacing them](https://cagov.github.io/covid19.ca.gov-site-eng-playbook/teams/content/replace-pdf.html)

Some content in WordPress requires using custom solutions created by the engineering team.

We have several [custom widgets and posts](https://cagov.github.io/covid19.ca.gov-site-eng-playbook/teams/content/backend.html), including:

* [Redirects](https://cagov.github.io/covid19.ca.gov-site-eng-playbook/teams/content/redirects.html)
* [Menus](https://teamdocs.covid19.ca.gov/teams/content/menu.html)
* Updating the [homepage](https://cagov.github.io/covid19.ca.gov-site-eng-playbook/teams/content/homepage.html), incuding:
  * [Headline banner](https://cagov.github.io/covid19.ca.gov-site-eng-playbook/teams/content/banner.html)
  * [Link grid](https://teamdocs.covid19.ca.gov/teams/content/featured-links.html)
  * [Video section](https://cagov.github.io/covid19.ca.gov-site-eng-playbook/teams/content/video.html)
