## Design Process

### 1. Identify a need
The design process typically starts with a request from the Product Team which may be responding to the following types of challenges. Depending on the type of challenge, the Product Team will have defined the requirements based on input from research, analytics, stakeholder requirements, etc.

#### User challenges
Challenges or opportunities informed by insights from the reasearch or analytics team. For example, making industry guidance easier to discover based on feedback and analytics indicating that users were having trouble finding information relevant to their industry.

#### Business challenges
Request from government stakeholders based on new policies and priorities. For example, introducing regional maps during the period of the Regional Stay at Home Order.

#### Internal challenges
Often, design will respond to a challenge faced by by the conten or engineering teams. For example, creating an "alert box" design patterns to help the content team communicate time-sensitive pieces of information. 

### 2. Prototype approaches
Based on research data and product requirements, design will explore a range of solutions and prototype them with Figma. This is often done in collaboration with the broader team. Miro is used to facilitate group ideation for larger projects. Slack and Jira can be used to share ideas for smaller projects.

Engineering resources are often a bottleneck: find low-lift solutions whenever possible. When designing new UI components, priortize things that can be used throughout the website (i.e. avoid one-off solutions).

### 3. Collect feedback and iterate
Depending on the project, the prototype may be used by the [Research Team](https://teamdocs.covid19.ca.gov/teams/rad/research.html) to collect feedback from users. In other projects, prototypes are only shared internally.

### 4. Document and handoff
Design often takes responsibility for putting designs and requirements into Jira to ensure the engineering understands what to build. We ensure that requirements are in scope by collaborating with Engineering.

### 5. QA
Throughout the development and launch of a product, it is Design's responsibility to help do QA and support engineering with any additional documentation or revisions that may be required. During QA, we are putting bugs and design improvements into Jira.

## Tools

### Figma
Figma is our design tool of choice. We use it to explore ideas, share approaches, collaborate, and manage assets. 

### Miro
We us Miro for collaborative whiteboarding sessions. As a design tool, it is used to facilitate workshops with other team members.

### Jira
We use Jira to track progress of all tasks. For design, Jira is a way to share designs for feedback, track progress, and perform QA as the project moves into development.
