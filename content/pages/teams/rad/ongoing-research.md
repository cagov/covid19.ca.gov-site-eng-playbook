# üîè UX Auditing


- ü•Ö **Purpose**:  identify common pain points across key user flows 
- üî¶ **Method**: UX Audit where the internal team mapped out the entire user flow to get a clear picture of all the different pages and actions users take to perform specific tasks
- üß∞ **Tools**:  miro, google docs, google slides, spreadsheet, quicktime
- üß© **Setup and steps**: 


| Steps 	| Process 	| Tools 	|
|-	|-	|-	|
| Design study 	| A small team of one designer, one researcher and one data analyst met to design the study 	| Clara Gonzalez Sueyro (Researcher) and Adam Little ( designer) and Britt Allen (data analyst) 	|
| Create scenarios 	| Based on google analytics, GO office priorities and other feedback sources we created 10 scenarios 	| Britt Allen(Data analyst) 	|
| Assign scenarios 	| Each team member chose one or more scenarios to perform the audit 	| Britt, Clara, Adam and Jessica Lopez 	|
| Execute audit 	| Each team member identified the parts of the website that provided an answer to the user‚Äôs question in the scenario. 	| Britt, Clara, Adam and Jessica Lopez 	|
| Visualize audit 	| Each member created a map that showed all of the ways that a user might get there (including search). Each one chose to visualize the steps involved through a flow chart, mind map, or something similar. 	| Britt, Clara, Adam and Jessica Lopez 	|
| Uncover pain points 	| For each step in the flow, the team identified:<br>potential ‚Äúpain points‚Äù that made the process difficult (e.g. confusing labeling) 	| Britt, Clara, Adam and Jessica Lopez 	|
| Find themes 	| As a group we synthesized pain points to determine themes/trends  	| Britt, Clara, Adam and Jessica Lopez 	|
| Define heuristics 	| Defined our own heuristics to reuse in future audits 	| Clara and Adam 	|
| Score scenarios 	| Scored each flow with the usability rubric 	|  	|
| Create list of quick wins and big improvements 	| For each theme, we created a list with small wins and big improvements<br>Small Wins: try to introduce them immediately. <br>Big Improvements:  large-scale improvements/problems that we would like to tackle in our next major redesign. 	| Clara and Adam 	|
