### Health Equity Context
The Equity page goal is to elevate the disparities in covid-19 so they can be focused on and addressed. This is part of a greater initiative to spur counties to demonstrate that they’re using their funding to support the communities most impacted.

### Health Equity Research goals:
We soft-launched the equity page to elevate these disparities. We wanted to take an opportunity to learn more about the visitors’ familiarity with the Health equity topic and assess their understanding of the data visualizations.

### Health Equity Research objective:

- Understand our visitors ability and familiarity with the topic. 
- Assess the visitors' understanding of the data visualizations.
- Assess the usability of the page.


### Health Equity Research questions:
- Who visits this page?
- What do they expect to find on this page?
- How do they navigate the page?
- What core message do they get out of the page? 
- What sections are relevant to each audience?
- How do they understand and explain the content of the data visualizations?


### Health Equity Research methodology
For this project, we decided on two different methods:

- Intercepted 87 visitors and learnt from their experience as they navigate the page.
- Performed 5 usability testing sessions with people with diverse background and familiarity with the topic of health equity.

### Health Equity Recruitment criteria

Some of our recruitment criteria were:

- Different familiarity and background.
- Different profficiency in the use of technology.

We used the following tools for recruitment:

- Ethnio intercepts.
- Friends & family for usability testing sessions.

### Health Equity Sample questions

Ethnio intercept questions:

1. Why did you visit California's commitment to health equity page?

- How familiar are you with the issue of health equity?
- Not at all familiar
- Somewhat familiar
- Very familiar

2. Based on what you’ve read, what do you take away from this page?

3. Is there other information you want to see on this page?
- No
- Yes (we’d like to know what it is)

4. What do you intend to do with this information? (Select all that apply.)
- Share it with colleagues and friends
- Read more about health and equity
- Digest it and come back later
- Contact a community based organization to collaborate with them
- Contact my local officials to learn more about what’s being done in my county and/or city
- Not much else
- Other (if you’d like to share, feel free) 

5. Which best describes you?
- I work for a city or county government 
- I am policymaker with a city or county government
- I'm a member of the public
- I work for a data provider (like a health system or a lab)
- I’m a member of the press
- Other

6. With which community do you identify? (This question is optional and you can select as apply)
- White
- Black or African American
- American Indian or Alaska Native
- Asian
- Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander
- Hispanic or Latino
- Another community

### Health Equity Analysis and synthesis
We reviewed the data from the intercepts and the usability testing sessions and created a word document and presentation with the findings from both methods. We also created a spreadsheet with findings, hyphotesis and recommendations.

- We have identified two segments of users with different prior knowledge, abilities and overall expectations.

1. For the people who are familiar with the topic, this page is a great attempt but it falls short. This group is looking for more data that they could use to perform their own analysis.   
2. For people who are not very familiar with the issue, this page is quite sophisticated and it’s almost too advanced. The first two sections seem enough for a first attempt to learn about the issue and a great introduction to inequalities around race and ethnicity. This group is looking for more educational resources and a guided experience.

### Health Equity Next steps

There are two possible approaches to our segmented audience:

1. Design for all: by presenting the same exact information in different ways we will provide different perspectives in understanding and interpreting information. This approach will satisfy the needs of audiences with different prior knowledge and experiences. It means meeting people where they are. 
2. Design for one specific audience by delivering information intentionally to satisfy those specific needs. 

- For our next steps, we recommend that we decide if we strive to make information understandable for all audiences and, evaluate **understandability** for each audience and iterate until it reaches an acceptable level of understanding. 
- In the short term, we can make raw data accessible to people who are interested in using it for their own research. This will not only empower these users but also strenghthen our approach towards transparency in government.
