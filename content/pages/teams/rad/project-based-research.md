User experience research methods and activities undertaken to carry out the research of a diverse set of projects.

1. **Call center** as a source of recruitment to perform interviews
2. **Ethnio intercepts** to gather data from visitors
3. **User Testing** to evaluate the ux and usability of a specific page

We reccomend a collaborative approach across different skill sets to successfully execute each activity. 

These are the roles/skills we have used when implementing each of the tools mentioned above.

## üì± Call Center
- The **call center** is being used as a **source for recruitment** to reach out to **harder to reach** previously identified groups such as Spanish speaking population who represent a higher % of the total population in California and have been highly impacted by covid-19. 
- We have used the referrals from the call center to perform **interviews**. 
- These are the steps taken to use the call center as a source for recruitment: 

| **Steps** 	| **Process** 	| **Tools** 	| **Improvements** 	| **Roles and team at covid19** 	|
|-	|-	|-	|-	|-	|
| Meet with call center coordinator 	| One time meeting with coordinator to define desired flow 	| Spreadsheet, slack and email 	| This is a pretty straightforward process 	| Call center coordinator and Reresearcher	|
| Define screener  	| Email sent to the coordinator and then forward to the call center operators.   	| Email 	| Evaluating a direct contact with operators 	| Researcher and coordinator 	|
| Ask call center operators to complete a spreadsheet 	| The operator needs to complete a spreadsheet with screener questions.<br>This seems to be a time consuming process for the call center operators, specially when dealing with high number of incoming calls 	| Spreadsheet 	| Redirect the phone call to the researcher. The researcher will have to put time on hold in case phone calls are redirected.  	| Call center operators 	|
| Share with researcher participants information 	| The call center shares every week a list of names with phone numbers and some demographic information. <br>Oftentimes the contact information is not enough to make an informed decision about best candidates in terms of recruiting a diverse pool. <br>Call center operators don‚Äôt ask for a lot of demographic information.  	| Spreadsheet 	| With the new flow, the operator will use his/her/they own judgment to redirect participants that have a lot to share 	| Call center operator (Maximus) 	|
| Send text message to participants to request to choose a time and date to be interviewed 	| Most scheduling tools that are free do ask for email addresses which not everyone that calls the call center have.  These free versions also have a lot of advertising which undermines the trustworthiness of the process. 	| Scheduling tools: calendly, doodle 	| By having someone redirecting in real time phone calls to the researcher we avoid the struggles and pain points around the scheduling tools. 	| Researcher 	|
| Send reminder 	| Some tools require you to have the paid version to access this feature.  	| Text 	| No need to do that with new flow. 	| Researcher 	|
| Perform interview 	| A 30 minute interview is performed  	| Phone 	|  	| Researcher 	|
| Pay incentive 	| Once the interview is finished the participant will receive a $20 gift card sent from ethnio software tool. One big pain point is due to the way our credit card is set up our chief of administration needs to call ethnio every time a payment is sent.   	| Ethnio 	| If ethnio is something we want to keep using we could add money to the platform and we will not have to call after every transaction. 	| Chief of Administration 	|

## ü¶â Ethnio Intercepts

- **Ethnio intercepts** are used as a tool to **gather feedback from existing visitors we were unable to reach out with other tools**. Circumstances and context matter in user research, and someone who‚Äôs using the website in **real time, for real purposes**, is going to behave differently than someone who‚Äôs just being told to accomplish some task via other platforms. We have also used ethnio intercepts as a **source for recruitment** 
- We use ethnio to **uncover visitor's context of use and motivations when using the site**. We have used that information to better address those contexts and **perform interviews** to dig deeper. 
- **Link**: [ethnio](https://ethn.io)
- These are the steps taken to use the ethnio as a source for recruitment and data gathering tool: 



| Steps 	| Process 	| Tools 	| Improvements 	| Roles and team at covid19 	|
|-	|-	|-	|-	|-	|
| Get or renew a subscription 	| Pay a subscription. 	| ethnio 	| We were able to get additional features for free due to the nature of our work. 	| Chief of Administration 	|
| Onboard and assign seats 	| The chief of administration needs to manually add or reassign seats  	| ethnio 	|  	| Chief of Administration 	|
| Design study 	| Create a script and screener or duplicate an existing one and change name 	| screener 	|  	| Researcher 	|
| Define recruitment method: intercept, link or native app intercept.  	| If choosing an intercept the researcher needs to share the javascript code with the engineer team or content captain for the page to add to the desired page. <br>If choosing a link there is no need to share.  	| javascript code 	| Every time an intercept is turned off it is ideal to request the team to remove the line of javascript. Not only is in favor of accessibility practices but also it consumes pageviews which we have a limited amount per billing cycle.  	| Researcher 	|
| Turn intercept on 	| There is an on-off switch in the dashboard next to each screener. 	| ethnio 	|  	| Researcher 	|
| Download responses and create a report 	| Download all responses to: XLSX or CSV or XML. There is also a pdf option with predetermined graphs for closed ended questions.  	| ethnio/ export data 	|  	| Researcher 	|

**Example of an intercept**

## üìù User Testing

- We performe **usability testing sessions** with specific audiences to **test the performance of newly launched pages or soon to be launch ones**. We use the sessions to evaluate the user experience and uncover usability issues for the specific pages. 
- We use usertesting.com to observe people as they interact with the page and perform a specific task.
- **Link**: [usertesting.com](https://www.usertesting.com/)
- These are the steps taken to use User Testing as a tool to perform usability testing sessions.

| Steps 	| Process 	| Tools 	| Improvements 	|
|-	|-	|-	|-	|
| Get or renew subscription 	| Pay subscription. 	| usertesting.com 	| Chief of Administration	|
| Assign seats 	| Negotiate the numbers of tests and seats 	| usertesting.com 	|  Chief of Administration 	|
| Define goals and desired outcomes for a specific test 	| Create a script and screener or duplicate an existing one and change name.<br>Define number of participants. 	| usertesting.com 	| Researcher, content designer and ux designer 	|
| Create report and share findings 	| Usertesting records videos and can help create clips. There is a manual process to view videos and incorporate findings in a report 	| PPT/ usertesting.com 	| Researcher 	|
