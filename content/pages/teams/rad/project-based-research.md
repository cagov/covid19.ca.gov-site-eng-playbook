Research activities undertaken to carry out the research of a diverse set of projects.


# ðŸ“± Call Center
- ðŸ¥…  **Purpose**: reach out to harder to reach previously identified groups such as Spanish speaking population who represent a higher % of the total population in California and have been highly impacted by covid-19. 
- ðŸ”¦ **Method**: interviews via call center referrals
- ðŸ§° **Tools**:  phone, spreadsheet
- ðŸ§© **Setup and steps**: 

| **Steps** 	| **Process** 	| **Tools** 	| **Improvements** 	| **Roles and team at covid19** 	|
|-	|-	|-	|-	|-	|
| Meet with call center coordinator 	| One time meeting with coordinator to define desired flow 	| Spreadsheet, slack and email 	| This is a pretty straightforward process 	| Anne Descalzo (coordinator) and Clara Gonzalez Sueyro (researcher) 	|
| Define screener  	| Email sent to the coordinator and then forward to the call center operators.   	| Email 	| Evaluating a direct contact with operators 	| Researcher and coordinator 	|
| Ask call center operators to complete a spreadsheet 	| The operator needs to complete a spreadsheet with screener questions.<br>This seems to be a time consuming process for the call center operators, specially when dealing with high number of incoming calls 	| Spreadsheet 	| Redirect the phone call to the researcher. The researcher will have to put time on hold in case phone calls are redirected.  	| Call center operators (Maximus) 	|
| Share with researcher participants information 	| The call center shares every week a list of names with phone numbers and some demographic information. <br>Oftentimes the contact information is not enough to make an informed decision about best candidates in terms of recruiting a diverse pool. <br>Call center operators donâ€™t ask for a lot of demographic information.  	| Spreadsheet 	| With the new flow, the operator will use his/her/they own judgment to redirect participants that have a lot to share 	| Call center operator (Maximus) 	|
| Send text message to participants to request to choose a time and date to be interviewed 	| Most scheduling tools that are free do ask for email addresses which not everyone that calls the call center have or they have a lot of advertising which undermines the trustworthiness of the process. 	| Scheduling tools: calendly, doodle 	| By having someone redirecting in real time phone calls to the researcher we avoid the struggles and pain points around the scheduling tools. 	| Researcher 	|
| Send reminder 	| Some tools require you to have the paid version to access this feature.  	| Text 	| No need to do that with new flow. 	| Researcher 	|
| Perform interview 	| A 30 minute interview is performed  	| Phone 	|  	| Researcher 	|
| Pay incentive 	| Once the interview is finished the participant will receive a $20 gift card sent from ethnio software tool. One big pain point is due to the way our credit card is set up our chief of administration (Debra Waltman)  needs to call ethnio every time a payment is sent.   	| Ethnio 	| If ethnio is something we want to keep using we could add money to the platform and we will not have to call after every transaction. 	| Chief of Administration 	|

# ðŸ”¬ Ethnio Intercepts

- ðŸ¥… **Purpose**: gather feedback from existing visitors we were unable to reach out with other tools such as usertesting.com. Circumstances matter a lot in user research, and someone whoâ€™s using the website in real timer, for real purposes, is going to behave differentlyâ€“and probably more accurate feedbackâ€“than someone whoâ€™s just being told to accomplish some task via usertesting.com
- ðŸ”¦ **Method**: intercept visitors to learn from our existing user base. 
- ðŸ§° **Tools**: [ethnio](https://ethn.io)
- ðŸ§© **Setup and steps**: 


| Steps 	| Process 	| Tools 	| Improvements 	| Roles and team at covid19 	|
|-	|-	|-	|-	|-	|
| Get or renew a subscription 	| Pay a subscription. 	| ethnio 	| We were able to get additional features for free due to the nature of our work. 	| Chief of Administration<br>(Debra) 	|
| Onboard and assign seats 	| Debra needs to manually add or reassign seats  	| ethnio 	|  	| Debra 	|
| Design study 	| Create a script and screener or duplicate an existing one and change name 	| screener 	|  	| Researcher 	|
| Define recruitment method: intercept, link or native app intercept.  	| If choosing an intercept the researcher needs to share the javascript code with the engineer team to add to the desired page. <br>If choosing a link there is no need to share.  	| javascript code 	| Every time an intercept is turned off it is ideal to request the team to remove the line of javascript. Not only is in favor of accessibility practices but also it consumes pageviews which we have a limited amount per billing cycle.  	| Researcher 	|
| Turn intercept on 	| There is an on-off switch in the dashboard next to each screener. 	| ethnio 	|  	| Researcher 	|
| Download responses and create a report 	| Download all responses to: XLSX or CSV or XML. There is also a pdf option with predetermined graphs for some questions.  	| ethnio/ export data 	|  	| Researcher 	|

# ðŸ’» Usability Testing

- ðŸ¥… **Purpose**: perform usability testing sessions with intended audiences to test the performance of newly launched pages. Evaluate the user experience and uncover usability issues
- ðŸ”¦ **Method**: get people to interact with the page and observe their behavior when performing a specific task
- ðŸ§° **Tools**: [usertesting.com](https://www.usertesting.com/)
- ðŸ§© **Setup and steps**: 

| Steps 	| Process 	| Tools 	| Improvements 	|
|-	|-	|-	|-	|
| Get or renew subscription 	| Pay subscription. 	| usertesting.com 	| Chief of Administration<br>(Debra) 	|
| Assign seats 	| Negotiate the numbers of tests and seats 	| usertesting.com 	| Debra 	|
| Define goals and desired outcomes for a specific test 	| Create a script and screener or duplicate an existing one and change name.<br>Define number of participants. 	| usertesting.com 	| Researcher, content designer and ux designer 	|
| Create report and share findings 	| Usertesting records videos and can help create clips. There is a manual process to view videos and incorporate findings in a report 	| PPT/ usertesting.com 	| Researcher 	|
