We use user experience (UX) research methods and activities across a diverse set of projects:

1. **Call center** as a source of recruitment to perform interviews
2. **Ethnio intercepts** to gather data from visitors
3. **User testing** to evaluate the UX and usability of a specific page

We reccomend a collaborative approach across different skill sets to successfully execute each activity. 

These are the roles/skills we've used when implementing each of the tools mentioned above:

## üì± Call Center

The call center is a source for recruitment to gather information from groups that are harder-to-reach, like Spanish speakers (who represent a significant percentage of the total population of California and have been highly impacted by COVID-19). We use the referrals from the call center to perform interviews.

We used the call center to learn about Spanish speakers' thoughts and feelings about vaccines.

Here's how we use the call center to recruit interview participants:

| **Steps** 	| **Process** 	| **Tools** 	| **Improvements** 	| **COVID-19 roles and team** 	|
|-	|-	|-	|-	|-	|
| Meet with call center coordinator 	| One-time meeting with coordinator to define the flow 	| Spreadsheet, Slack, and email 	| This is a pretty straightforward process as is 	| Researcher and call center coordinator	|
| Define screener  	| Send email to the call center coordinator and then forward to the call center operators.   	| Email 	| Consider a direct contact with operators 	| Researcher and call center coordinator 	|
| Call center operators to complete a spreadsheet 	| The operator completes a spreadsheet with screener questions. (This can be a time consuming process for the call center operators, especially when dealing with a high number of incoming calls.) 	| Spreadsheet 	| Redirect the phone call to the researcher. This requires the researcher reserving time in case phone calls are redirected.  	| Call center operators 	|
| Share with researcher participants information 	| The call center shares every week a list of names with phone numbers and some demographic information. The contact call center operators usually may not collect enough information to identify the best candidates.  	| Spreadsheet 	| Empower operators to use their own judgment to redirect participants 	| Call center operator (Maximus) 	|
| Request and schedule an interview 	| Most free scheduling tools ask for email addresses and not everyone has one. These free versions also have advertising that undermines the trustworthiness of the process. 	| Text, Calendly, Doodle 	| Redirect callers to the researcher to avoid the pain points in the scheduling tools 	| Researcher 	|
| Send reminder 	| Some tools require a paid version to access this feature.  	| Text 	| Eliminated by redirecting callers 	| Researcher 	|
| Perform interview 	| Interviews are usually 30 minutes.  	| Phone 	|  	| Researcher 	|
| Send incentive 	| $20 gift cards are sent through Ethnio. This requires the ODI Chief of Administration calling ethnio every time a payment is sent.   	| Ethnio 	| Money can be added to Ethnio that prevents a call for every transaction. 	| Chief of Administration 	|

## ü¶â Ethnio intercepts

We use [Ethnio](https://ethn.io) intercepts to gather feedback from existing visitors we are unable to reach out with other tools. Circumstances and context matter in user research, and someone who‚Äôs using the website in real time, for real purposes, will behave differently than someone who‚Äôs being told to accomplish some task via other platforms. We also use Ethnio intercepts as a source for recruitment./ 

We also use Ethnio to uncover visitor's context of use and motivations when using the site. We use this information to better address those contexts and perform interviews to dig deeper into those motivations. 

Projects where we have used ethnio intercepts include:

* [Vaccines](https://covid19.ca.gov/vaccines/) (English and Spanish)
* [Health equity](https://covid19.ca.gov/equity/)
* [Industry guidance](https://covid19.ca.gov/industry-guidance/)
* [Help for older adults](https://covid19.ca.gov/help-for-seniors/)

Here's how to use Ethnio to gather data and recruit interview participants:

| Steps 	| Process 	| Tools 	| Improvements 	| Roles and team at covid19 	|
|-	|-	|-	|-	|-	|
| Get or renew a subscription 	| Pay a subscription. 	| ethnio 	| We were able to get additional features for free due to the nature of our work. 	| Chief of Administration 	|
| Onboard and assign seats 	| The chief of administration needs to manually add or reassign seats  	| ethnio 	|  	| Chief of Administration 	|
| Design study 	| Create a script and screener or duplicate an existing one and change name 	| screener 	|  	| Researcher 	|
| Define recruitment method: intercept, link or native app intercept.  	| If choosing an intercept the researcher needs to share the javascript code with the engineer team or content captain for the page to add to the desired page. <br>If choosing a link there is no need to share.  	| javascript code 	| Every time an intercept is turned off it is ideal to request the team to remove the line of javascript. Not only is in favor of accessibility practices but also it consumes pageviews which we have a limited amount per billing cycle.  	| Researcher 	|
| Turn intercept on 	| There is an on-off switch in the dashboard next to each screener. 	| ethnio 	|  	| Researcher 	|
| Download responses and create a report 	| Download all responses to: XLSX or CSV or XML. There is also a pdf option with predetermined graphs for closed ended questions.  	| ethnio/ export data 	|  	| Researcher 	|

## üìù User Testing

- We perform **usability testing sessions** with specific audiences to **test the performance of newly launched pages or prototypes**. We use the sessions to evaluate the user experience and uncover usability issues for the specific pages. 
- We use usertesting.com to observe people as they interact with the page and perform a specific task.
- **Link**: [usertesting.com](https://www.usertesting.com/)
- Projects where we have used user testing: homepage redesign, industry guidance page and blueprint page.
- These are the steps to use User Testing as a tool to perform usability testing sessions.

| Steps 	| Process 	| Tools 	| Improvements 	|
|-	|-	|-	|-	|
| Get or renew subscription 	| Pay subscription. 	| user testing	| Chief of Administration	|
| Assign seats 	| Negotiate the numbers of tests and seats 	| user testing	|  Chief of Administration 	|
| Define goals and desired outcomes for a specific test 	| Create a script and screener or duplicate an existing one and change name.<br>Define number and type of participants. 	| user testing 	| Researcher, content designer and ux designer 	|
| Create report and share findings 	| Usertesting records videos and can help create clips. There is a manual process to view videos and incorporate findings in a report 	| google slides & user testing	| Researcher 	|
