### Industry Guidance Context
The industry guidance page is the fourth most visited page since May 2020. It has been a high priority for the Governor’s Office and haven’t had a significant update since May 12. This page is key to the work of many stakeholders: city and county officials, business owners, business associations and members of the public. With new restrictions in place, this page becomes a go-to resource for many businesses and it was in need of a redesign.

### Industry Guidance Timeline
Overall, the project took a total of 10 weeks.

- Discussing the project: 1 week
- Recruitment: 2 weeks
- Conducting research: 3 weeks
- Analysis: 2 weeks
- Report: 2 weeks


### Industry Guidance Research Goals
- With this reasearch we wanted to challenge our existing assumptions by testing the usability and experience of the page with real visitors and define the priorities and tasks for each of our groups. 

### Industry Guidance Objectives:
- Understand the motivations for each user segment to visit the industry guidance.
- Understand how they navigate the page.
- Understand what users prioritize when checking the industry guidance page.
- Understand if the taxonomy of industries is relevant to each segment’s business type.
- Understand when would they revisit the page and for what purpose.

### Industry Guidance Research methodology:
For this project, we decided on three different methods to fit the timeline and the research goals:

1.  **Intercept visitors** as they navigate the industry guidance page to understand who they were and what they were trying to accomplish. 
- Intercept 70 people visiting the industry guidance page and follow up with 20 phone interviews.
3.  **Interview key stakeholders** such as GoBiz (California Governor's Office of Business and Economic Development) and business representatives to understand about their jobs and how do they use the page to serve their customers.
4.  **Perform usability testing sessions** to evaluate our existing page in terms of usability and ux focusing on relevance, hierarchy and accessibility.
- Usability testing sessions with 5 business owners in California.

### Industry Guidance Recruitment criteria 
Some of our recruitment criteria were:

- A diverse set of visitors: business owners, goverment employees, members of the public, business associations.
- Business owners from a diverse set of industries and diverse buisness size.
- Users with a different frequency of visits.
- Live amd work in California.


### Industry Guidance outputs and deliverables

- We put together a report with a summary of the key takeaways and pain points. We also included videos and links to more information. 
- We segmented the visitors in three groups and delivered detailed information for each segment. These groups enabled the team to define what to prioritize next.

Business owners           |  Government officials          |  Members of the public         |

![Business owmers](https://cagov.github.io/covid19.ca.gov-site-eng-playbook/content/images/business.jpg)  |  ![Government officials](https://cagov.github.io/covid19.ca.gov-site-eng-playbook/content/images/government.jpg) | ![Public](https://cagov.github.io/covid19.ca.gov-site-eng-playbook/content/images/public.jpg)

Our core visitor is the **county and city official** because: 

- they visit industry page multiple times a week.
- they refer others to the state website.
- they use the page in detail.
- content is key to the execution of their job.
- information and content is copied and cascaded to county websites.

Our secondary audience is the **business owner**. They:

- visit industry page when moving to new tier or after the governor's briefing.
- get most of the information from the accordions.
- get advice from county officials and business alliances on specifics when definitions such as ”with modifications” are unclear or state and county roles are conflicting.

- We also put together a spreadsheet with key findings and recommendations for the team to prioritize.

- This is a snapshot of the spreadsheet with key findings:

| Section 	| Findings 	| Recommendations 	| User Segment 	|
|-	|-	|-	|-	|
| Navigation (from Blueprint) 	| When visiting directly from the blueprint page, essential business can’t find any additional information and assume there are no restrictions. 	| Content: Consider adding essential business in the list of activities. 	| All of the users 	|
|  	| In the Blueprint page, the link to the industry guidance gets lost in the results. 	| Design: Consider making the link more relevant. 	| All of the users 	|
|  	| When coming to the industry guidance from results in the blueprint, visitors expect to see a detailed explanation of “with modifications” means. 	| Content: Consider adding a clarification of what “modifications” stand for. 	| All of the users 	|
|  	| If the result doesn’t provide guidance, there is no easy access to the industry guidance page. 	| Content: Consider adding a link to the Industry guidance page in the results so visitors can still find the page. 	| All of the users 	|
| Navigation (from Homepage) 	| The language from the homepage to access industry guidance page is confusing 	| Design: Consider creating a link to access the industry guidance from homepage that is consistent with the title of the page. 	| Business owners 	|
|  	| The different routes to access the industry guidance page are inconsistent:<br>what’s open, county status, How can I safely open my business. Industry guidance (footer) menu -> working safely -> Industry guidance 	| Design: Consider adding a section addressing business needs on the homepage. 	| Business owners 	|
|  	| When coming from the homepage, the visitor has no information about tiers. Which tier are we now? 	| Design: Consider adding or replicating the what’s open search in the industry guidance for people coming directly or from homepage. 	| All of the users 	|


- We also delivered a content gap analysis to discover “gaps” in addressing visitors' needs with the existing content:

| User segment 	| User need 	| Does content exist? 	| Can they find it and use it? 	|
|-	|-	|-	|-	|
| City officials 	| I want to know what are the new updated guidances 	| Yes 	| Sometimes 	|
| City officials 	| I want to know what is different from state and county guidances to make better judgments when informing the residents & businesses 	| No 	| No 	|
| City officials 	| I want to know what has changed in the new guidance so I can update our website with the new content. 	| Yes 	| Sometimes 	|
| Business owners 	| I want to know what category my business falls under. 	| Sometimes 	| Sometimes 	|
| Business owners 	| I want to find the right guidance that applies to the different parts of my business. For example: I own a hotel that also has a pool and restaurant. 	| Sometimes 	| Sometimes 	|
| Business owners 	| I want to find best practices to keep my employees and customers safe. For example, how often do we need to test? Do we need to do contract tracing? 	| Sometimes 	| No 	|
| Business owners 	| I want to know how my business will be affected if we move tiers so I can be prepared. 	| Sometimes 	| Sometimes 	|
| Business owners 	| I want to know who is in charge of regulations, guidances, enforcement, etc 	| No 	| No 	|
| Consumers 	| I want to fact check information regarding how businesses are following regulations in my county so I can decide what to do. 	| Yes 	| Sometimes 	|
| Consumers 	| I want to have the latest information about which activities are allowed in my county. 	| Yes 	| Sometimes 	|

### Industry Guidance Impact

- The post-launch feedback user research, and analysis of data identified some gaps and opportunities in both the industry guidance page and how it intersects with the blueprint Framework.

- The team decided that the best solution was an updated blueprint page design that incorporates industry guidance in a unified context. This solution addresses most of existing problems, streamlines the experience, and makes industry guidance easier to update, maintain and track.


| Prioritized Challenges 	| Solution 	| Success Metric 	|
|-	|-	|-	|
| Industry Guidance difficult to find (“find the guidance I’m interested in faster”). Users had to go through list manually  	| Add all industries to What’s open search (e.g., Agriculture, Cohorts, Manufacturing, Communications, Public transit, Mining, etc.). 	| Reduction in complaints re difficulty in finding guidance. 	|
| Users had to know the precise industry category term to find the relevant guidance. 	| Search and display of results now distinguish activities (such as Yoga) from Industry Categories (such as Gyms & Fitness Centers), so users no longer need to specify the exact term to find the relevant guidance, and specify precisely that “activity-name must follow guidance for industry-name.” 	| Reduction in complaints along the lines of “I searched yoga but you showed me gyms”. 	|
| Business users have not always realized that they may need to take heed of guidances from related industries. 	| The What’s Open search results for a given industry now also cite other industry guidances that might also be relevant, for example a gym might also have a cafe so this possibility is highlighted. 	| Metric to benchmark and track to see if goal gets achieved? 	|
| Site search is driving a larger than anticipated general public audience to the Industry Guidance page. 	| Incorporation of Industry Guidance information into the Blueprint context serves all audiences without increasing complexity.  	| Reduction in requests for support from general public users trying to make sense of the dedicated IG page. 	|
| Only 14% open PDFs, and it’s hard to see what part of a PDF was updated even if you do open it. 	| Guidance and Checklist PDFs are presented in context for the relevant industry without requiring a separate effort to find. 	| Hard to compare without an IG landing page, but the percentage of people who open PDFs after expanding the details of a search result should go up, as should the overall percentage of visitors who open PDFs. Target should be 2x to start. 	|
| Guidance depends on what tier your county is in but the IG page isn’t context-aware about what tier your county is in. 	| Because the Industry Guidance content is displayed as part of What’s Open search results the specified county’s tier is shown in the same context. 	| Reduction in complaints that tier information is lacking from Guidance PDFs. 	|
| Some users want to anticipate what the guidance will be if the tier changes. 	| The user can see the information for all tiers by leaving out the county information or by searching on a county that is in another tier. 	| Metric to benchmark and track to see if goal gets achieved? 	|
| Users seeking industry guidance are not always aware that there may be related county guidance that goes beyond the state mandates. 	| The new design is more intentional about the language to make this clear, and offers links to relevant county websites. 	| Metric to benchmark and track to see if goal gets achieved? 	|

The lead designer prototyped the proposed solution which still relies on communicating information through PDFs, but it also incorporates the value of the “Search Results”. Now a user can find their industry guidance through the search features and also get information about their tier in context. Two of the unmet needs uncovered during the resesarch process.

### Industry Guidance Reflections

What went well:
- With the merge of the industry guidance and the blueprint page we are improving the publication flow which helps the stakeholders with their day to day work.
- We have a created a more collaborative workflow with stakeholders than what we had.


Challenges:
- We know that only 14% of visitors open the PDF but we are redesigning the page with PDFs as the core piece. We are redesigning the page to make the guidance and checklist PDFs presented in context for the relevant industry without requiring a separate effort to find but we are taking a big risk that can lead to a lower user satisfaction if we don't do a great job since data is showing low open rate for PDFs with current page.
