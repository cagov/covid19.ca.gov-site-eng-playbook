# Tips for Success (aka Lessons Learned)


1. Set time for generative/discovery research and exploratory data analysis that will help inform new avenues to satisfy unmet needs and unmet segments.
2. Draw the line and find the balance between what people want and when and what is the right solution. Visitors always ask for more than what they need. It is the team's decision to set a balance.
3. Spend time building systems and processes that can scale and become reusable. 
4. Communicate with other stakeholders and agencies early on and include them in the process to avoid duplicated projects and strengthen buy- in from partners and fruitful collaborations.
