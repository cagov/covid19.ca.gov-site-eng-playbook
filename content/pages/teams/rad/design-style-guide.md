## Principles

Our design principles help teams and stakeholders to align on design vision and decision-making. They give us a shared understanding to help us prioritize our next steps.

The principles that we use for [covid19.ca.gov](http://covid19.ca.gov) are the same as Alpha which leverage the proven work and best practices of teams like [18F](https://methods.18f.gov/decide/design-principles/) and the [UK Government Digital Services](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-design-principles). 

### The Alpha.CA.gov design principles include:
* Start with user needs
* Do less
* Design with data, research, intuition, and experimentation (We added “research, intuition and experimentation” for a few reasons. Data doesn’t always tell the whole story. We also need user research, experimentation and, yes, our own intuition as users and Californians to inform design.)
* Do the hard work to make it simple and elegant
* Iterate — then iterate again
* Make it accessible and inclusive (UK.GOV went with “This is for everyone.” We adapted it to make it more explicit and reflect California.)
* Understand context
* Build digital services, not websites
* Be consistent but not uniform
* Make things open: It makes things better
* Prioritize security, respect privacy (Something new we added to the list. A recognition of how incredibly important both security and privacy are.)
* Optimize performance (Another new one. Slow load times cost people money. That’s an accessibility and equity issue.)
* These principles will inform our product design. And we’ll continue to iterate and refine them as we learn by doing.

### Accessibile and Inclusive Design

[covid19.ca.gov](http://covid19.ca.gov) aligns with Web Content Accessibility Guideline (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA Standards in addition to the requirements of Section 508 (29 U.S.C. 794d), which you can read more about at [https://webstandards.ca.gov/accessibility](https://webstandards.ca.gov/accessibility/). Needless to say, design plays a role in this through use of color contrast, layout and heirarchy, sizes of touch targets, data visualization, and more. We recommend [accessibility.digital.gov](https://accessibility.digital.gov/) as a resource to learn more about accessible and inclusive design.

### Responsive Design

At the time of writing this documentation, ##% of traffic to [covid19.ca.gov](http://covid19.ca.gov) was on mobile devices. All design decisions consider mobile and desktop platforms simultaneously and place a special empahsis on optimizing performance for low-end mobile devices. For example, we have worked hard to take data dashboards published on Tableau and redesign them for D3 to ensure they load faster on a wider range of devices.

As the design principle above states: Slow load times cost people money. That’s an accessibility and equity issue.

## Style Guide

The foundational layer of the design components are based on [Bootstrap v4](https://getbootstrap.com) as well as the latest version of the [CA state web template](https://beta.template.webstandards.ca.gov). While the design of covid19.ca.gov was initially modelled after the [Alpha website](https://www.alpha.ca.gov/), it has since taken on it's own unique look and feel.

Below is a summary of key styles. For more detail, please refer to the [components and styles](https://teamdocs.covid19.ca.gov/components/) portion of this documentation.

### Typography
The main [COVID19](https://covid19.ca.gov) website uses Roboto and Montserrat typefaces. Mainly headings 1 through 4 are used throughout webpages. 

#### Headings 
* **Heading 1:** Montserrat bold 700, font-size 2.3rem
* **Heading 2:** Montserrat bold 700, font-size 2rem
* **Heading 3:** Roboto bold 700, font-size 1.5rem
* **Heading 4:** Roboto bold 700, font-size 1.4rem

#### Paragraph text 
* **paragraph:** Roboto regular 300, color #00000, font-size 1.2rem,  line height 1.5, paragraph spacing 1.2rem

### Colors
* **Primary color:** #1f2574
* **Secondary color:** #003d9d
* **Accent color:** #f2f5fc
* **Accent color:** #ff8000
* **Accent color:** #92C5DE

### Icons
The state web template includes an [icon font](https://beta.template.webstandards.ca.gov/sample/icon-fonts.html) and has several COVID related icons available. Additionally an open source [COVID icon font](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery&q=covid-19&m=free) is also available and complements the state icon font. 

### Branding 

* **Logos:** [California for all](https://govca.app.box.com/s/8wsb5ytp1sv2ivh5o0seqzz82sbt1oe5)
* **Images:** [Hero banner/Backgrounds](https://govca.app.box.com/s/1vk3x2d20fjplsciqonrrohdrlr8vzs3)

### Web Toolkit
A toolkit website that contains communications materials as well as graphical banners and imagery is also available at [COVID19 Response Toolkit](https://toolkit.covid19.ca.gov/partners/).
