## Principles

Our design principles help teams and stakeholders to align on design vision and decision-making. They give us a shared understanding to help us prioritize our next steps.

The principles that we use for covid19.ca.gov are the same as Alpha which leverage the proven work and best practices of teams like 18F and the UK Government Digital Services. 

### The Alpha.CA.gov design principles include:
* Start with user needs
* Do less
* Design with data, research, intuition, and experimentation (We added “research, intuition and experimentation” for a few reasons. Data doesn’t always tell the whole story. We also need user research, experimentation and, yes, our own intuition as users and Californians to inform design.)
* Do the hard work to make it simple and elegant
* Iterate — then iterate again
* Make it accessible and inclusive (UK.GOV went with “This is for everyone.” We adapted it to make it more explicit and reflect California.)
* Understand context
* Build digital services, not websites
* Be consistent but not uniform
* Make things open: It makes things better
* Prioritize security, respect privacy (Something new we added to the list. A recognition of how incredibly important both security and privacy are.)
* Optimize performance (Another new one. Slow load times cost people money. That’s an accessibility and equity issue.)
* These principles will inform our product design. And we’ll continue to iterate and refine them as we learn by doing.

## Style Guide

The foundational layer of the design components are based on [Bootstrap v4](https://getbootstrap.com) as well as the latest version of the [CA state web template](https://beta.template.webstandards.ca.gov). While the design of covid19.ca.gov was initially modelled after the [Alpha website](https://www.alpha.ca.gov/), it has since taken on it's own unique look and feel.

## Typography
The main [COVID19](https://covid19.ca.gov) website uses Roboto and Montserrat typefaces. Mainly headings 1 through 4 are used throughout webpages. 

### Headings 
* **Heading 1:** Montserrat bold 700, font-size 2.3rem
* **Heading 2:** Montserrat bold 700, font-size 2rem
* **Heading 3:** Roboto bold 700, font-size 1.5rem
* **Heading 4:** Roboto bold 700, font-size 1.4rem

### Paragraph text 
* **paragraph:** Roboto regular 300, color #00000, font-size 1.2rem,  line height 1.5, paragraph spacing 1.2rem

## Colors
* **Primary color:** #1f2574
* **Secondary color:** #003d9d
* **Accent color:** #f2f5fc
* **Accent color:** #ff8000
* **Accent color:** #92C5DE

## Icons
The state web template includes an [icon font](https://beta.template.webstandards.ca.gov/sample/icon-fonts.html) and has several COVID related icons available. Additionally an open source [COVID icon font](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery&q=covid-19&m=free) is also available and complements the state icon font. 

## Branding 

* **Logos:** [California for all](https://govca.app.box.com/s/8wsb5ytp1sv2ivh5o0seqzz82sbt1oe5)
* **Images:** [Hero banner/Backgrounds](https://govca.app.box.com/s/1vk3x2d20fjplsciqonrrohdrlr8vzs3)

## Web Toolkit
A toolkit website that contains communications materials as well as graphical banners and imagery is also available at [COVID19 Response Toolkit](https://toolkit.covid19.ca.gov/partners/).
