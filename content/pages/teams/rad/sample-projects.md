Sample projects are the activities undertaken to carry out the research for specific pages & themes. 
This section will introduce 4 different stories about projects we have accomplished and we will give the audience a step-by-step understanding of how we have approached them.
Each project had a slightly different approach in terms of goals, activities and stakeholders.
- The research for the **homepage redesign** was focusing on making sure the new redesign was satisfying the needs of our variuous audiences while keeping the alignment with the state voice and brand. 
- The **Industry guidance** focus was to understand why and how diferrent audiences use the page so we provide relevant information to facilitate each segments tasks.
- The **blueprint for a safer economy** research  was to evaluate the understanding of the new framework the governor had announced and underdstand how businesses and the public use the page. 
- The **Equity page** was a new page focusing on showcasing the inequities around health for certain communities and the research work was to discover how people with different prior knowledge and background on the topic experience the page and the content display in the visualizations.

## Homepage Iteration

### Context
The homepage iteration is a project we did to better understand the users perception about a newly redesign homepage for covid19.ca.gov.
The main challenge with this iteration of the homepage was ‚Äúrealignment‚Äù. The overall goal was to make sure that it served the core purpose of the website by satisfying visitors needs and that it was also aligned with the voice and brand of the CA covid-19 response approach.

### Usability script

Tasks
1. Before we show you the web page, please share what you know about the coronavirus, COVID-19. What are the most important topics you want to know about? Why those?
2. Launch URL
You have been taken to a new page about COVID-19. Please give honest feedback about what makes sense and what is not clear.
3. First, read through the home page. What are your first impressions? Does it seem like a reliable and trustworthy source of information? Who do you think is responsible for this web page? Does this page answer your initial questions about COVID-19?
4. Now, let's assume you want to find information about the monitoring list. Where do you go to find that information? Once you are on the page about monitoring lists, read through the information. What is useful information? What is not useful? [Success: Yes, No]
5. Now, go back to the Home page. Scroll down to the "People want to know" section. What do you think about the questions? Do they answer your initial questions about COVID-19? What other questions do you have?
6. Please stay on the Home page. If you haven't yet, click the question ‚ÄúWhat's open in my county?‚Äù and tell me what you think. What do you think about the other questions? Are they relevant? Irrelevant? Is anything missing? What do you think about the overall navigation? As news and information have been changing a lot about COVID-19, how often would you check this site?
7. I would trust this site. [9-point Rating Scale: Strongly disagree to Strongly agree]

### Findings:

- **Dashboard** ‚Üí **Updates**:
Uncertainty about the frequency of updates.
- **Hero section** ‚Üí **Visibility**:

## Industry Guidance Redesign

### Intro
The industry guidance page is the fourth most visited page since May 2020. It has been a high priority for the Governor‚Äôs Office and haven‚Äôt had a significant update since May 12. This page is key to the work of many stakeholders: city and county officials, business owners, business associations and members of the public. With new restrictions in place, this page becomes a go-to resource for many businesses and it was in need of a redesign.

### Goals
- Challenge existing assumptions by testing the usability and experience of the page with real visitors

### Objectives of the study:
- Understand why each segment would visit the industry guidance
- Understand how they navigate the page 
- Understand what they prioritize when checking the industry guidance page: what‚Äôs relevant and what‚Äôs not
- Understand when would they revisit the page and for what purpose: returning visitors

### Process:
1. Discover: interview stakeholders, perform user testing sessions and intercept visitors while performing a task
2. Define: use research data to identify opportunities for improvement.
-  summarize findings ‚Üí uncover patterns and themes ‚Üí create insights ‚Üí content gap analysis ‚Üí propose recommendations for MPV and V1


### Activities:
- **Intercept visitors** as they navigate the Industry guidance page to understand who they were and what they were trying to accomplish. 
- **Interview key stakeholders** such as GoBiz and business representatives to understand about their jobs and how do they use the page to serve their customers
- **Perform usability testing sessions** to evaluate our existing page in terms of usability and UX focusing on relevance, hierarchy and accessibility.

### üî¶ Findings:

| Section 	| Issue 	| Recommendations 	| User Segment 	|
|-	|-	|-	|-	|
| Navigation (from Blueprint) 	| When visiting directly from the blueprint page, essential business can‚Äôt find any additional information and assume there are no restrictions. 	| Content: Consider adding essential business in the list of activities. 	| All of the users 	|
|  	| In the Blueprint page, the link to the industry guidance gets lost in the results. 	| Design: Consider making the link more relevant. 	| All of the users 	|
|  	| When coming to the industry guidance from results in the blueprint, visitors expect to see a detailed explanation of ‚Äúwith modifications‚Äù means. 	| Content: Consider adding a clarification of what ‚Äúmodifications‚Äù stand for. 	| All of the users 	|
|  	| If the result doesn‚Äôt provide guidance, there is no easy access to the industry guidance page. 	| Content: Consider adding a link to the Industry guidance page in the results so visitors can still find the page. 	| All of the users 	|
| Navigation (from Homepage) 	| The language from the homepage to access industry guidance page is confusing 	| Design: Consider creating a link to access the industry guidance from homepage that is consistent with the title of the page. 	| Business owners 	|
|  	| The different routes to access the industry guidance page are inconsistent:<br>what‚Äôs open, county status, How can I safely open my business. Industry guidance (footer) menu -> working safely -> Industry guidance 	| Design: Consider adding a section addressing business needs on the homepage. 	| Business owners 	|
|  	| When coming from the homepage, the visitor has no information about tiers. Which tier are we now? 	| Design: Consider adding or replicating the what‚Äôs open search in the industry guidance for people coming directly or from homepage. 	| All of the users 	|

### Themes --> Inisghts

**Theme: Format of content (i.e. overcoming constraints of PDFs)**
- Only 14% open a PDF. We know people are coming to better understand what modifications do they need to follow with the current or new guidance.
- Visitors can‚Äôt easily recognize which parts of the PDF have changed/ are updated.
- From an analytic and research perspective PDFs present a challenge: can‚Äôt track what people are doing
- Length
- Too many links that create friction and distraction
- Loading time
- Cookies
**Possible Approaches**
- Publish guidance in a database so that guidance can be accessed outside of a PDF and accessed by section (not a whole)
- Change structure or organization of PDFs to make them easier for users to skim
**Discussion Question**
- Are there opportunities to publish content outside of the PDF format?

**Theme: Hierarchy of content (i.e. making modifications more evident)**
- Since information inside accordions in a web page is the most important and relevant content, we want to add some key bullet points there for easy discoverability and accessibility.
- Most businesses and even consumers come to the site to check more about what ‚Äúwith modifications mean‚Äù and what things should businesses follow.
**Possible Approaches**
- Coordinate all of the ‚Äúmodifications‚Äù in one place/page
**Discussion Question**
- How can we better communicate modifications without opening a PDF or by linking to the right area?
- How can we use the same language (modifications) and clearly communicate what those activities are in the accordion?
- What is the argument for displaying content in the current way
- Can we put all modifications together? Can we address the section with the word modifications to be consistent with the language used in the Blueprint. 

**Theme: Recency of content (i.e. showing latest updates)**
- Visitors can‚Äôt easily recognize which parts of the PDF have changed/ are updated.
- Visitors that see their guidelines being dated, even when they have changed tiers, feel anxious. This undermines the mission of the site as a source of truth.
**Possible Approaches**
- Consider highlighting/commenting sections that have changed or consider adding a summary with current updates. This will help city officials when they have to summarize changes for the people in their counties.
- Consider adding a comment to remove friction: ‚Äúthis guidance is still current or in effect regardless the date‚Äù
**Discussion Question**
- Can we find a way to easily communicate those changes for visitors to easily recognize what has changed?

**Theme: Specificity of content (i.e. making it easier to get to industry-specific guidance)**
- Most relevant content is specific to their business and it is found inside the accordion
- The content in the Reopen your business section and Employer‚Äôs section is a nice to have but it‚Äôs not what drives visitors to this page
**Possible Approaches**
- Separate ‚Äúgeneral‚Äù content from industry-specific content so that users can more easily find what is unique to their industry
**Discussion Question**
- Is there a possibility to remove general content from PDF and put in the webpage so that PDFs are specific to each business?

### Content gap analysis

| User segment 	| User need 	| Does content exist? 	| Can they find it and use it? 	|
|-	|-	|-	|-	|
| City officials 	| I want to know what are the new updated guidances 	| Yes 	| Sometimes 	|
| City officials 	| I want to know what is different from state and county guidances to make better judgments when informing the residents & businesses 	| No 	| No 	|
| City officials 	| I want to know what has changed in the new guidance so I can update our website with the new content. 	| Yes 	| Sometimes 	|
| Business owners 	| I want to know what category my business falls under. 	| Sometimes 	| Sometimes 	|
| Business owners 	| I want to find the right guidance that applies to the different parts of my business. For example: I own a hotel that also has a pool and restaurant. 	| Sometimes 	| Sometimes 	|
| Business owners 	| I want to find best practices to keep my employees and customers safe. For example, how often do we need to test? Do we need to do contract tracing? 	| Sometimes 	| No 	|
| Business owners 	| I want to know how my business will be affected if we move tiers so I can be prepared. 	| Sometimes 	| Sometimes 	|
| Business owners 	| I want to know who is in charge of regulations, guidances, enforcement, etc 	| No 	| No 	|
| Consumers 	| I want to fact check information regarding how businesses are following regulations in my county so I can decide what to do. 	| Yes 	| Sometimes 	|
| Consumers 	| I want to have the latest information about which activities are allowed in my county. 	| Yes 	| Sometimes 	|

## Blueprint & What‚Äôs Open Search

### Intro
The Governor‚Äôs Office announced a new reopening framework for business sectors. This is a new state criteria for reopening businesses. More ‚Äúprescriptive / dynamic criteria‚Äù based on local health officials and experience gained from the past months. 
We have designed a new page to communicate this new framework and want to test it with business owners and members of the public.

### Goals: 

- Evaluate the understanding of the new framework
- Assess the user experience of the page 

### Purpose of the study:

- Identify difficulties and roadblocks participants experience when using the Blueprint page.
- Understand what participants are thinking and feeling as they execute tasks / prompts.
- Assess if the framework delivers a clear understanding of what businesses and individuals can do and why
- Identify what new information needs to be provided
- Align the new redesign and framework to people‚Äôs ability and understanding about what‚Äôs safe in their county


### Research questions:
- Are people able to accurately describe in their own words what purpose this page serves and what the different colors mean?

### Activities:

- Usability testing sessions with members of the public and business owners to uncover problems and points of confusion when using the Blueprint page
- Usabiliy testing sessions to assess the understanding of the new framework.

### Process:

1. Summarize findings ‚Üí cluster findings into UX and usability pain points and success moments ‚Üí recommendations

### Findings:
- 8 out 10 haven‚Äôt heard about the new framework.
- 9 out 10 haven‚Äôt been to this page before.
- [+] Participants appreciate the consistency of information, especially the visual coherence.  

**Section: Risk level graphic**
- [+] This section is easy to understand. 
- [-] Widespread color purple doesn‚Äôt represent the most dangerous tier.
- [+] Labels are self-explanatory and memorable.
- [-] Low recognition of how counties move from tiers. 

**Section: Map**
- [+] Maps are highly desirable for creating awareness.  Participants find the map useful for uncovering the risk level of their county and compare it with neighbor counties and the overall state. 
- [-] Harder to navigate on mobile. 

- Contrary to what we expected, participants didn‚Äôt seem confused by previous frameworks.

|   Sections 	| UX 	| Usability 	|   	|
|-	|-	|-	|-	|
| <br>   Status of activity 	| It‚Äôs  nice to have. Participants tend to find out about what‚Äôs open and closed at the local/business level by searching Yelp/Google. <br>Activities need further clarification. Some participants are confused by what the reach and meaning of activity is: is it about going to the beach or a business type? 	| Intuitive and easy to use. Some usability issues were uncovered (non-existent businesses create some friction.  Results on mobile present some delivery issues - see slide 20) 	|   	|
|    Tiers 	| Labels are self-explanatory and meaningful. Widespread purple is not meaningful.<br>Case rate and positive rate are clear but some participants expect to see the real number for their counties.  	|  Easy to read and navigate. 	|   	|
|   Map 	| Desirable and memorable. New information. Great piece to create awareness. 	| Non intuitive on mobile. (friction regarding searchability and clickability) 	|   	|

## Health Equity Dashboard

### Intro
We soft-launched the equity page and wanted to take an opportunity to learn more about the visitors‚Äô familiarity with the topic and assess their understanding of the data visualizations.

### Goals:
- Understand our audiences ability and familiarity with the topic 
- Identify our core segments and how to best address their needs
- Identify our audiences knowledge gaps


### Purpose of the study:
- Assess the visitors understanding of the page‚Äôs content 
- Assess the usability of the page


### Research questions:
- Who visits this page?
- What do they expect to find on this page?
- How do they navigate the page?
- What core message do they get out of the page? 
- What sections are relevant to each audience?
- How do they understand the data visualizations?


### Activities:
- Intercept visitors and learn from their experience as they navigate the page
- Perform usability testing sessions with people with diverse background and familiarity with the issue of health equity.

### Findings:

- We have identified two segments of users with different prior knowledge, abilities and overall expectations.

1. People who are familiar with the issue: this page is a great attempt to represent the issue. This group is looking for more data that they could use to perform their own analysis.   
2. People who are not very familiar with the issue: for this group this page is quite sophisticated and it‚Äôs almost too advanced. The main two sections seem enough for a first attempt to learn about the issue and a great introduction to inequalities around race and ethnicity. 

### Recommendations:
There are possible approaches to our segmented audience:

1. Design for all: by presenting the same exact information in different ways we will provide different perspectives in understanding and interpreting information. This approach will satisfy the needs of audiences with different prior knowledge and experiences. It means meeting people where they are. 
2. Design for an intended audience and for a specific goal in mind: delivering information intentionally to satisfy those specific needs. 

- For our next steps, we recommend that we decide if we strive to make information understandable for all audiences and, evaluate **understandability** for each audience and iterate until it reaches an acceptable level of understanding.
