Sample projects is the section that introduces UX methods and activities undertaken to carry out the research for specific pages.

This section will introduce 4 different projects with a step-by-step understanding of how we have approached each of them.


- The goal for the [Homepage Redesign](#homepage-redesign) was to make sure the new redesign was satisfying the needs of our visitors while keeping the alignment with the state's voice and brand. 
- The goal for [Industry Guidance Redesign](#industry-guidance-redesign) was to understand why and how different visitors use the page so we could provide relevant information to facilitate their tasks.
- The goal for the [Blueprint for a safer economy page](#blueprint-for-a-safer-economy-page) was to evaluate the understanding of the new framework the governor had announced and underdstand how businesses and the public use the page. 
- The [Health Equity page](#health-equity-page) was a page that wanted to highlight the existing inequities in health for certain communities. The goal of the research was to discover how people with different prior knowledge and background on the topic experience the information and data visualizations.
