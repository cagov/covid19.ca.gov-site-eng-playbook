Sample projects is the section that introduces UX methods and activities undertaken to carry out the research for specific pages.

This section will introduce 4 different projects with a step-by-step understanding of how we have approached each of them.


- The goal for the [Homepage Redesign](#homepage-redesign) was to make sure the new redesign was satisfying the needs of our visitors while keeping the alignment with the state's voice and brand. 
- The goal for [Industry Guidance Redesign](#industry-guidance-redesign) was to understand why and how different visitors use the page so we could provide relevant information to facilitate their tasks.
- The goal for the [Blueprint for a safer economy page](#blueprint-for-a-safer-economy-page) was to evaluate the understanding of the new framework the governor had announced and underdstand how businesses and the public use the page. 
- The [Health Equity page](#health-equity-page) was a page that wanted to highlight the existing inequities in health for certain communities. The goal of the research was to discover how people with different prior knowledge and background on the topic experience the information and data visualizations.

### Blueprint Context
On August 28th, 2020, the Governor’s office announced a new reopening framework for business sectors. This is a new state criteria for reopening businesses. More “prescriptive / dynamic criteria” based on local health officials and experience gained from the past months. 
As part of the administration’s focus on the reopening, we designed a new page to communicate this new framework and want to test it with business owners and members of the public to evaluate people's understanding  of the framework and test the usability of the page to get the message out.  

### Blueprint Timeline:
Overall, the project took a total of 5 weeks.

- Designing the research: 1 week
- Recruitment: 1 week
- Conducting research: 1 week
- Analysis: 1 week
- Report: 1 week

### Blueprint Research goals: 
- Evaluate the understanding of the new framework.
- Assess the user experience of the page.

### Blueprint Objectives:

- Identify difficulties and roadblocks participants experience when using the Blueprint page.
- Understand what participants are thinking and feeling as they execute tasks / prompts.
- Assess if the framework delivers a clear understanding of what businesses and individuals can do and why.
- Identify what new information needs to be provided.
- Align the new redesign and framework to people’s ability and understanding about what’s safe in their county.

### Blueprint Research methodology:
- We performed 10 usability testing sessions with members of the public and business owners to uncover problems and points of confusion when reviewing the blueprint page and assessing the understanding of the new framework.

### Blueprint Recruitment criteria:
Some of our recruitment criteria were:

- Members of the public with and without kids.
- Business owners in different industries, business sizes, various income brackets and counties in California.
- Age: 18-65+
- Geography: California.
- Language: English.
- Devices: mobile and desktop.

We used the following tools for recruitment:
- Usertesting.com

### Blueprint Usability script:

1. Briefly share how COVID-19 has impacted you and your family.
2. Have you heard about the new framework California is using to manage restrictions in counties? 
3. Have you been to this page before? First, read through the page and tell us what would you want to know about activities?
4. Choose an activity/business and find information about it in your county. Tell us what you think about the results.  Was anything confusing? Anything missing? 
5. Now, look at the County risk level graphic. What do you think about the levels/tiers? Are the labels/names meaningful? Why do you feel that way? What about the colors? How would you describe each level/tier in your own words?
What do you want to know about your county? Now, scroll down to the map. Search for your county. What information stands out? What’s next? What is useful about the map? What is confusing?
6. Now, find Tehama county. Do you understand why Tehama is in purple/widespread risk level? If so, explain why it is in this tier.
7. Based on the information on this page, can you explain how a county moves forward or backward to another level/tier?
8. After reviewing this page, do you think it helps people know what’s safe, what’s not, and how this system works? 


### Blueprint Analysis and synthesis:
We syntehsized each usability testing session after reviewing the videos. We took notes directly into a google document and then coded the data about tasks into a spreadsheet. We also used this opportunity to highlight relevant quotes.

### Blueprint Outputs and deliverables
- We put together a report. In this report, we summarized the key takeaways and pain points we were finding. In this report, we also included videos and links to more information.

- This is a snapshot of some findings around usability and user experience:

|   Sections 	| UX 	| Usability 	|   	|
|-	|-	|-	|-	|
| <br>   Status of activity 	| It’s  nice to have. Participants tend to find out about what’s open and closed at the local/business level by searching Yelp/Google. <br>Activities need further clarification. Some participants are confused by what the reach and meaning of activity is: is it about going to the beach or a business type? 	| Intuitive and easy to use. Some usability issues were uncovered (non-existent businesses create some friction.  Results on mobile present some delivery issues - see slide 20) 	|   	|
|    Tiers 	| Labels are self-explanatory and meaningful. Widespread purple is not meaningful.<br>Case rate and positive rate are clear but some participants expect to see the real number for their counties.  	|  Easy to read and navigate. 	|   	|
|   Map 	| Desirable and memorable. New information. Great piece to create awareness. 	| Non intuitive on mobile. (friction regarding searchability and clickability) 	|   	|

### Blueprint Impact

This research informed the team about the visitors' points of confusion around the framework and issues around the usability of the page. We proposed changes in the content hierarchy that were taken into consideration and implemented in newer iterations of the page.

### Health Equity Context
The Equity page goal is to elevate the disparities in covid-19 so they can be focused on and addressed. This is part of a greater initiative to spur counties to demonstrate that they’re using their funding to support the communities most impacted.

### Health Equity Research goals:
We soft-launched the equity page to elevate these disparities. We wanted to take an opportunity to learn more about the visitors’ familiarity with the Health equity topic and assess their understanding of the data visualizations.

### Health Equity Research objective:

- Understand our visitors ability and familiarity with the topic. 
- Assess the visitors' understanding of the data visualizations.
- Assess the usability of the page.


### Health Equity Research questions:
- Who visits this page?
- What do they expect to find on this page?
- How do they navigate the page?
- What core message do they get out of the page? 
- What sections are relevant to each audience?
- How do they understand and explain the content of the data visualizations?


### Health Equity Research methodology
For this project, we decided on two different methods:

- Intercepted 87 visitors and learnt from their experience as they navigate the page.
- Performed 5 usability testing sessions with people with diverse background and familiarity with the topic of health equity.

### Health Equity Recruitment criteria

Some of our recruitment criteria were:

- Different familiarity and background.
- Different profficiency in the use of technology.

We used the following tools for recruitment:

- Ethnio intercepts.
- Friends & family for usability testing sessions.

### Health Equity Sample questions

Ethnio intercept questions:

1. Why did you visit California's commitment to health equity page?

- How familiar are you with the issue of health equity?
- Not at all familiar
- Somewhat familiar
- Very familiar

2. Based on what you’ve read, what do you take away from this page?

3. Is there other information you want to see on this page?
- No
- Yes (we’d like to know what it is)

4. What do you intend to do with this information? (Select all that apply.)
- Share it with colleagues and friends
- Read more about health and equity
- Digest it and come back later
- Contact a community based organization to collaborate with them
- Contact my local officials to learn more about what’s being done in my county and/or city
- Not much else
- Other (if you’d like to share, feel free) 

5. Which best describes you?
- I work for a city or county government 
- I am policymaker with a city or county government
- I'm a member of the public
- I work for a data provider (like a health system or a lab)
- I’m a member of the press
- Other

6. With which community do you identify? (This question is optional and you can select as apply)
- White
- Black or African American
- American Indian or Alaska Native
- Asian
- Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander
- Hispanic or Latino
- Another community

### Health Equity Analysis and synthesis
We reviewed the data from the intercepts and the usability testing sessions and created a word document and presentation with the findings from both methods. We also created a spreadsheet with findings, hyphotesis and recommendations. 

![Equity](https://cagov.github.io/covid19.ca.gov-site-eng-playbook/content/images/equity.jpg)

- We have identified two segments of users with different prior knowledge, abilities and overall expectations.

1. For the people who are familiar with the topic, this page is a great attempt but it falls short. This group is looking for more data that they could use to perform their own analysis.   
2. For people who are not very familiar with the issue, this page is quite sophisticated and it’s almost too advanced. The first two sections seem enough for a first attempt to learn about the issue and a great introduction to inequalities around race and ethnicity. This group is looking for more educational resources and a guided experience.

### Health Equity Next steps

There are two possible approaches to our segmented audience:

1. Design for all: by presenting the same exact information in different ways we will provide different perspectives in understanding and interpreting information. This approach will satisfy the needs of audiences with different prior knowledge and experiences. It means meeting people where they are. 
2. Design for one specific audience by delivering information intentionally to satisfy those specific needs. 

- For our next steps, we recommend that we decide if we strive to make information understandable for all audiences and, evaluate **understandability** for each audience and iterate until it reaches an acceptable level of understanding. 
- In the short term, we can make raw data accessible to people who are interested in using it for their own research. This will not only empower these users but also strenghthen our approach towards transparency in government.
