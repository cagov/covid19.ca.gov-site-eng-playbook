Here are 4 projects, detailing our approach step-by-step:

* [Homepage redesign](https://teamdocs.covid19.ca.gov/teams/rad/homepage.html): confirm that the new redesign satisfied the needs of visitors and was aligned with the state's voice and brand 
* [Industry Guidance redesign](https://teamdocs.covid19.ca.gov/teams/rad/industry-guidance.html): understand why and how different visitors use the page so we could provide relevant information to facilitate their tasks.
* [Blueprint for a Safer Economy](https://teamdocs.covid19.ca.gov/teams/rad/blueprint-safer.html): evaluate people's understanding of the new framework and underdstand how businesses and the public use the page. 
* [Health Equity](https://teamdocs.covid19.ca.gov/teams/rad/health-equity.html): discover how people with different levels of knowledge and background on the topic experience the information and data visualizations.
