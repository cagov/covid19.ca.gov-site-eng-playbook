Sample projects is the section that introduces the activities undertaken to carry out the research for specific pages.

This section will introduce 4 different projects with a step-by-step understanding of how we have approached each of them.


- The goal for the **[homepage redesign](#homepage-redesign)** was to make sure the new redesign was satisfying the needs of our visitors while keeping the alignment with the state's voice and brand. 
- The goal for **[Industry guidance redesign](#industruy-guidance-redesign)** was to understand why and how different visitors use the page so we could provide relevant information to facilitate their tasks.
- The goal for the **[Blueprint for a safer economy page design](#blueprint-for-a-safer-economy-page)** was to evaluate the understanding of the new framework the governor had announced and underdstand how businesses and the public use the page. 
- The **[Health Equity page](#health-equity-page)** was a page that wanted to highlight the existing inequities in health for certain communities. The goal of the research was to discover how people with different prior knowledge and background on the topic experience the page and the content from the visualizations.

### Context
The homepage redesign is a project we did to better understand the visitors perception of a new homepage redesign for covid19.ca.gov.
The main challenge with this iteration of the homepage was “realignment”. The overall goal was to make sure that it served the core purpose of the website by satisfying visitors needs and that it was also aligned with the voice and brand of the CA covid-19 response approach.

### Timeline

Overall, the project took a total of one and a half months. 

- Discussing the project: 1 week
- Designing research proposal: 1 week
- Recruiting and conducting research: 1 week
- Analysis: 2 weeks:
- Report: 1 week


### Research goals
- Test if the redesign is aligned with the websites core values 
- Test the user experience of our visitors when performing key tasks
- Test the look and feel of the new homepage

### Objectives:
- Identify difficulties and roadblocks participants experience when using the new homepage
- Understand what participants are thinking and feeling as they execute tasks / prompts

### Research methodology:
For this project, we decided to perform **10 usability testing sessions**. 

### Recruitment criteria:

**Criteria:**
- Income: range betwen less than 40,000 to mre than 100,000
- Device: 5 on mobile devices and 5 on desktop
- Age: across ages
- Geography: California only
- Language: English

We used the following **tool for recruitment**:

- usertesting.com

### Usability script

Tasks
1. Before we show you the web page, please share what you know about the coronavirus, COVID-19. What are the most important topics you want to know about? Why those?
2. Launch URL
You have been taken to a new page about COVID-19. Please give honest feedback about what makes sense and what is not clear.
3. First, read through the home page. What are your first impressions? Does it seem like a reliable and trustworthy source of information? Who do you think is responsible for this web page? Does this page answer your initial questions about COVID-19?
4. Now, let's assume you want to find information about the monitoring list. Where do you go to find that information? Once you are on the page about monitoring lists, read through the information. What is useful information? What is not useful? [Success: Yes, No]
5. Now, go back to the Home page. Scroll down to the "People want to know" section. What do you think about the questions? Do they answer your initial questions about COVID-19? What other questions do you have?
6. Please stay on the Home page. If you haven't yet, click the question “What's open in my county?” and tell me what you think. What do you think about the other questions? Are they relevant? Irrelevant? Is anything missing? What do you think about the overall navigation? As news and information have been changing a lot about COVID-19, how often would you check this site?
7. I would trust this site. [9-point Rating Scale: Strongly disagree to Strongly agree]


### Analysis and synthesis 

I syntehsize each usability testing session after reviewing the videos. I took notes directly into a google document and then coded the data with key tasks into a spreadsheet. I also used this opportunity to highlight relevant quotes. 

![Homepage](https://cagov.github.io/covid19.ca.gov-site-eng-playbook/content/images/coding.jpg)


### Output and deliverables:

- We put together a report. In this report, we summarized the key takeaways and pain points we were finding. In this report, we included videos and links to more information.

- We also put together a sreadsheet with key findings and recommendations for the team to prioritize.

- This is a snapshot of the spreadsheet with key findings:

| Section 	| Issue 	| Recommendations 	|  	|
|-	|-	|-	|-	|
| Tracking COVID-19 	| Uncertainty related to cases and deaths percentages [P2] 	| Consider adding a timeframe 	|  	|
|  	| Participants expressed doubts about the frequency of the updates. The data is 2 days old, participants question why isn’t it updated every hour or at least the day before. [Don't do] 	|  	|  	|
|  	| Participants also expressed doubts regarding the timeframe for the percentages. +0.7 up from last report?” yesterday? last week? last month? P1-clara, [Duplicate, B5] 	|  	|  	|
|  	| Confusion around number of tests: unique or total P1-Clara, [P1] 	| Consider adding a clarification 	|  	|
|  	| Cases and deaths are perceived as useless for business owners because they are not directly correlated to a business type/industry [Don't do] 	| Consider breaking cases by industry 	|  	|
|  	| People clicking the County map in Dashboard are redirected to status but are looking for a map. [P1] [P1] [P1--already have a ticket] 	| Make this link go directly to the map on the Blueprint page by A) an anchor link or B) moving the map to the top of the Blueprint page.<br>Alternatively, since the map is now on the State Dashboard, we could have a single link called "view all state and county data" 	|  	|
|  	| Tests are perceived as a metric that could be useful for business owners by increasing their confidence in reopening P2 [Don't do] 	| Consider providing information regarding test numbers per county 	|  	|

### Impact

This research helped the agency understand how users experience the page. The findings and insights were used in the prioritization process and were taken into consideration when finalizing the design.

|   Sections 	| UX 	| Usability 	|
|-	|-	|-	|
|  Tracking COVID-19 	| Memorable and useful<br>Impactful 	| Participants are finding labels to be incomplete and not fully descriptive 	|
|  News banner 	| Relevant to individuals, not as much to business owners. Nice to have section. 	| Some concerns around the representation of the icon that is giving the wrong message: danger 	|
|  Video Resources 	| Not memorable or useful.  	|   	|
| People want to know 	| Highly valuable and meaningful section.  Relevant questions to the public but not much to business owners. 	|   	|
| Latest news 	| Participants didn’t find this section relevant to their needs.  	|   	|

### Reflections

What went well:
1.  The agency used the research to make improvements.
3.  Usability testing became the norm when launching new pages.

Challenges:
1. The research team was approached quite late in the process when the design was almost done. An early prototype would have given us more time to test with a diverse set of users.

### Context
The industry guidance page is the fourth most visited page since May 2020. It has been a high priority for the Governor’s Office and haven’t had a significant update since May 12. This page is key to the work of many stakeholders: city and county officials, business owners, business associations and members of the public. With new restrictions in place, this page becomes a go-to resource for many businesses and it was in need of a redesign.

### Timeline
Overall, the project took a total of 10 weeks.

- Discussing the project: 1 week
- Recruitment: 2 weeks
- Conducting research: 3 weeks
- Analysis: 2 weeks
- Report: 2 weeks


### Research Goals
- With this reasearch we wanted to challenge our existing assumptions by testing the usability and experience of the page with real visitors and define the priorities and tasks for each of our groups. 

### Objectives:
- Understand the motivations for each user segment to visit the industry guidance.
- Understand how they navigate the page.
- Understand what users prioritize when checking the industry guidance page.
- Understand if the taxonomy of industries is relevant to each segment’s business type.
- Understand when would they revisit the page and for what purpose.

### Research methodology:
For this project, we decided on three different methods to fit the timeline and the research goals:


1.  **Intercept visitors** as they navigate the Industry guidance page to understand who they were and what they were trying to accomplish. 
- Intercept 70 people visiting the industry guidance page and follow up with 20 phone interviews
3.  **Interview key stakeholders** such as GoBiz (California Governor's Office of Business and Economic Development) and business representatives to understand about their jobs and how do they use the page to serve their customers
4.  **Perform usability testing sessions** to evaluate our existing page in terms of usability and UX focusing on relevance, hierarchy and accessibility.
- Usability testing sessions with 5 business owners in California


### Recruitment criteria 
Some of our recruitment criteria were:

- A diverse set of visitors: business owners, goverement employees, members of the public, business associations
- Business owners from a diverse set of industries and diverse buisness size
- Users with a different frequency of visits
- Live in CA


### Outputs and deliverables

- We put together a report with a summary of the key takeaways and pain points. We also included videos and links to more information. 
- We segmented the visitors in three groups and delivered detailed information for each segment. As a team we had many assumptions about who was using our page and why. These groups enabled the team to anchor decision-making, and what should be prioritized next.

Business owners           |  Government officials          |  Members of the public         |    
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:
![Business owmers](https://cagov.github.io/covid19.ca.gov-site-eng-playbook/content/images/business.jpg)  |  ![Government officials](https://cagov.github.io/covid19.ca.gov-site-eng-playbook/content/images/government.jpg) | ![Public](https://cagov.github.io/covid19.ca.gov-site-eng-playbook/content/images/public.jpg)

Our core visitor is the **county and city official** because they: 

- Visit industry page multiple times a week
- Refer others to the state website
- Use page in detail
- Content is key to the execution of their job
- Information and content is copied and cascaded to county websites

Our secondary audience is the **business owner**. They:

- Visit industry page when moving to new tier or after the governor's briefing
- Not fully motivated to open the PDF
- Get most of the information from the accordions
- Get advice from county officials and business alliances on specifics when definitions such as ”with modifications” are unclear or state and county roles are conflicting.

![Public](https://cagov.github.io/covid19.ca.gov-site-eng-playbook/content/images/engagement.jpg)


- We also put together a spreadsheet with key findings and recommendations for the team to prioritize.

- This is a snapshot of the spreadsheet with key findings:

| Section 	| Issue 	| Recommendations 	| User Segment 	|
|-	|-	|-	|-	|
| Navigation (from Blueprint) 	| When visiting directly from the blueprint page, essential business can’t find any additional information and assume there are no restrictions. 	| Content: Consider adding essential business in the list of activities. 	| All of the users 	|
|  	| In the Blueprint page, the link to the industry guidance gets lost in the results. 	| Design: Consider making the link more relevant. 	| All of the users 	|
|  	| When coming to the industry guidance from results in the blueprint, visitors expect to see a detailed explanation of “with modifications” means. 	| Content: Consider adding a clarification of what “modifications” stand for. 	| All of the users 	|
|  	| If the result doesn’t provide guidance, there is no easy access to the industry guidance page. 	| Content: Consider adding a link to the Industry guidance page in the results so visitors can still find the page. 	| All of the users 	|
| Navigation (from Homepage) 	| The language from the homepage to access industry guidance page is confusing 	| Design: Consider creating a link to access the industry guidance from homepage that is consistent with the title of the page. 	| Business owners 	|
|  	| The different routes to access the industry guidance page are inconsistent:<br>what’s open, county status, How can I safely open my business. Industry guidance (footer) menu -> working safely -> Industry guidance 	| Design: Consider adding a section addressing business needs on the homepage. 	| Business owners 	|
|  	| When coming from the homepage, the visitor has no information about tiers. Which tier are we now? 	| Design: Consider adding or replicating the what’s open search in the industry guidance for people coming directly or from homepage. 	| All of the users 	|


- We also delivered a content gap analysis to compare the current content with the desired content performance for each segment.

| User segment 	| User need 	| Does content exist? 	| Can they find it and use it? 	|
|-	|-	|-	|-	|
| City officials 	| I want to know what are the new updated guidances 	| Yes 	| Sometimes 	|
| City officials 	| I want to know what is different from state and county guidances to make better judgments when informing the residents & businesses 	| No 	| No 	|
| City officials 	| I want to know what has changed in the new guidance so I can update our website with the new content. 	| Yes 	| Sometimes 	|
| Business owners 	| I want to know what category my business falls under. 	| Sometimes 	| Sometimes 	|
| Business owners 	| I want to find the right guidance that applies to the different parts of my business. For example: I own a hotel that also has a pool and restaurant. 	| Sometimes 	| Sometimes 	|
| Business owners 	| I want to find best practices to keep my employees and customers safe. For example, how often do we need to test? Do we need to do contract tracing? 	| Sometimes 	| No 	|
| Business owners 	| I want to know how my business will be affected if we move tiers so I can be prepared. 	| Sometimes 	| Sometimes 	|
| Business owners 	| I want to know who is in charge of regulations, guidances, enforcement, etc 	| No 	| No 	|
| Consumers 	| I want to fact check information regarding how businesses are following regulations in my county so I can decide what to do. 	| Yes 	| Sometimes 	|
| Consumers 	| I want to have the latest information about which activities are allowed in my county. 	| Yes 	| Sometimes 	|

### Impact

- Post-launch feedback from users, user research, and analysis of data identified some gaps and opportunities in both the Industry Guidance page and how it intersects with the Blueprint Framework.

- The core team decided that the best solution was solution was an updated Blueprint design that incorporates industry guidance in a unified context. This solution addresses most of existing problems, streamlines the experience, and makes Industry Guidance easier to update, maintain and track.


| Prioritized Challenges 	| Solution 	| Success Metric 	|
|-	|-	|-	|
| Industry Guidance difficult to find (“find the guidance I’m interested in faster”). Users had to go through list manually  	| Add all industries to What’s open search (e.g., Agriculture, Cohorts, Manufacturing, Communications, Public transit, Mining, etc.). 	| Reduction in complaints re difficulty in finding guidance. 	|
| Users had to know the precise industry category term to find the relevant guidance. 	| Search and display of results now distinguish activities (such as Yoga) from Industry Categories (such as Gyms & Fitness Centers), so users no longer need to specify the exact term to find the relevant guidance, and specify precisely that “activity-name must follow guidance for industry-name.” 	| Reduction in complaints along the lines of “I searched yoga but you showed me gyms”. 	|
| Business users have not always realized that they may need to take heed of guidances from related industries. 	| The What’s Open search results for a given industry now also cite other industry guidances that might also be relevant, for example a gym might also have a cafe so this possibility is highlighted. 	| Metric to benchmark and track to see if goal gets achieved? 	|
| Site search is driving a larger than anticipated general public audience to the Industry Guidance page. 	| Incorporation of Industry Guidance information into the Blueprint context serves all audiences without increasing complexity.  	| Reduction in requests for support from general public users trying to make sense of the dedicated IG page. 	|
| Only 14% open PDFs, and it’s hard to see what part of a PDF was updated even if you do open it. 	| Guidance and Checklist PDFs are presented in context for the relevant industry without requiring a separate effort to find. 	| Hard to compare without an IG landing page, but the percentage of people who open PDFs after expanding the details of a search result should go up, as should the overall percentage of visitors who open PDFs. Target should be 2x to start. 	|
| Guidance depends on what tier your county is in but the IG page isn’t context-aware about what tier your county is in. 	| Because the Industry Guidance content is displayed as part of What’s Open search results the specified county’s tier is shown in the same context. 	| Reduction in complaints that tier information is lacking from Guidance PDFs. 	|
| Some users want to anticipate what the guidance will be if the tier changes. 	| The user can see the information for all tiers by leaving out the county information or by searching on a county that is in another tier. 	| Metric to benchmark and track to see if goal gets achieved? 	|
| Users seeking industry guidance are not always aware that there may be related county guidance that goes beyond the state mandates. 	| The new design is more intentional about the language to make this clear, and offers links to relevant county websites. 	| Metric to benchmark and track to see if goal gets achieved? 	|

## Blueprint for a safer economy page

### Intro
The Governor’s Office announced a new reopening framework for business sectors. This is a new state criteria for reopening businesses. More “prescriptive / dynamic criteria” based on local health officials and experience gained from the past months. 
We have designed a new page to communicate this new framework and want to test it with business owners and members of the public.

### Goals: 

- Evaluate the understanding of the new framework
- Assess the user experience of the page 

### Purpose of the study:

- Identify difficulties and roadblocks participants experience when using the Blueprint page.
- Understand what participants are thinking and feeling as they execute tasks / prompts.
- Assess if the framework delivers a clear understanding of what businesses and individuals can do and why
- Identify what new information needs to be provided
- Align the new redesign and framework to people’s ability and understanding about what’s safe in their county


### Research questions:
- Are people able to accurately describe in their own words what purpose this page serves and what the different colors mean?

### Activities:

- Usability testing sessions with members of the public and business owners to uncover problems and points of confusion when using the Blueprint page
- Usabiliy testing sessions to assess the understanding of the new framework.

### Process:

1. Summarize findings → cluster findings into UX and usability pain points and success moments → recommendations

### Findings:
- 8 out 10 haven’t heard about the new framework.
- 9 out 10 haven’t been to this page before.
- [+] Participants appreciate the consistency of information, especially the visual coherence.  

**Section: Risk level graphic**
- [+] This section is easy to understand. 
- [-] Widespread color purple doesn’t represent the most dangerous tier.
- [+] Labels are self-explanatory and memorable.
- [-] Low recognition of how counties move from tiers. 

**Section: Map**
- [+] Maps are highly desirable for creating awareness.  Participants find the map useful for uncovering the risk level of their county and compare it with neighbor counties and the overall state. 
- [-] Harder to navigate on mobile. 

- Contrary to what we expected, participants didn’t seem confused by previous frameworks.

|   Sections 	| UX 	| Usability 	|   	|
|-	|-	|-	|-	|
| <br>   Status of activity 	| It’s  nice to have. Participants tend to find out about what’s open and closed at the local/business level by searching Yelp/Google. <br>Activities need further clarification. Some participants are confused by what the reach and meaning of activity is: is it about going to the beach or a business type? 	| Intuitive and easy to use. Some usability issues were uncovered (non-existent businesses create some friction.  Results on mobile present some delivery issues - see slide 20) 	|   	|
|    Tiers 	| Labels are self-explanatory and meaningful. Widespread purple is not meaningful.<br>Case rate and positive rate are clear but some participants expect to see the real number for their counties.  	|  Easy to read and navigate. 	|   	|
|   Map 	| Desirable and memorable. New information. Great piece to create awareness. 	| Non intuitive on mobile. (friction regarding searchability and clickability) 	|   	|

## Health Equity page

### Intro
We soft-launched the equity page and wanted to take an opportunity to learn more about the visitors’ familiarity with the topic and assess their understanding of the data visualizations.

### Goals:
- Understand our audiences ability and familiarity with the topic 
- Identify our core segments and how to best address their needs
- Identify our audiences knowledge gaps


### Purpose of the study:
- Assess the visitors understanding of the page’s content 
- Assess the usability of the page


### Research questions:
- Who visits this page?
- What do they expect to find on this page?
- How do they navigate the page?
- What core message do they get out of the page? 
- What sections are relevant to each audience?
- How do they understand the data visualizations?


### Activities:
- Intercept visitors and learn from their experience as they navigate the page
- Perform usability testing sessions with people with diverse background and familiarity with the issue of health equity.

### Findings:

- We have identified two segments of users with different prior knowledge, abilities and overall expectations.

1. People who are familiar with the issue: this page is a great attempt to represent the issue. This group is looking for more data that they could use to perform their own analysis.   
2. People who are not very familiar with the issue: for this group this page is quite sophisticated and it’s almost too advanced. The main two sections seem enough for a first attempt to learn about the issue and a great introduction to inequalities around race and ethnicity. 

### Recommendations:
There are possible approaches to our segmented audience:

1. Design for all: by presenting the same exact information in different ways we will provide different perspectives in understanding and interpreting information. This approach will satisfy the needs of audiences with different prior knowledge and experiences. It means meeting people where they are. 
2. Design for an intended audience and for a specific goal in mind: delivering information intentionally to satisfy those specific needs. 

- For our next steps, we recommend that we decide if we strive to make information understandable for all audiences and, evaluate **understandability** for each audience and iterate until it reaches an acceptable level of understanding.
