Sample projects is the section that introduces UX methods and activities undertaken to carry out the research for specific pages.

This section will introduce 4 different projects with a step-by-step understanding of how we have approached each of them.


- The goal for the [Homepage Redesign](#homepage-redesign) was to make sure the new redesign was satisfying the needs of our visitors while keeping the alignment with the state's voice and brand. 
- The goal for [Industry Guidance Redesign](#industry-guidance-redesign) was to understand why and how different visitors use the page so we could provide relevant information to facilitate their tasks.
- The goal for the [Blueprint for a safer economy page](#blueprint-for-a-safer-economy-page) was to evaluate the understanding of the new framework the governor had announced and underdstand how businesses and the public use the page. 
- The [Health Equity page](#health-equity-page) was a page that wanted to highlight the existing inequities in health for certain communities. The goal of the research was to discover how people with different prior knowledge and background on the topic experience the information and data visualizations.

### Industry Guidance Context
The industry guidance page is the fourth most visited page since May 2020. It has been a high priority for the Governor’s Office and haven’t had a significant update since May 12. This page is key to the work of many stakeholders: city and county officials, business owners, business associations and members of the public. With new restrictions in place, this page becomes a go-to resource for many businesses and it was in need of a redesign.

### Industry Guidance Timeline
Overall, the project took a total of 10 weeks.

- Discussing the project: 1 week
- Recruitment: 2 weeks
- Conducting research: 3 weeks
- Analysis: 2 weeks
- Report: 2 weeks


### Industry Guidance Research Goals
- With this reasearch we wanted to challenge our existing assumptions by testing the usability and experience of the page with real visitors and define the priorities and tasks for each of our groups. 

### Industry Guidance Objectives:
- Understand the motivations for each user segment to visit the industry guidance.
- Understand how they navigate the page.
- Understand what users prioritize when checking the industry guidance page.
- Understand if the taxonomy of industries is relevant to each segment’s business type.
- Understand when would they revisit the page and for what purpose.

### Industry Guidance Research methodology:
For this project, we decided on three different methods to fit the timeline and the research goals:

1.  **Intercept visitors** as they navigate the industry guidance page to understand who they were and what they were trying to accomplish. 
- Intercept 70 people visiting the industry guidance page and follow up with 20 phone interviews.
3.  **Interview key stakeholders** such as GoBiz (California Governor's Office of Business and Economic Development) and business representatives to understand about their jobs and how do they use the page to serve their customers.
4.  **Perform usability testing sessions** to evaluate our existing page in terms of usability and ux focusing on relevance, hierarchy and accessibility.
- Usability testing sessions with 5 business owners in California.


Intercept           |  Interviews            |  Usability testing
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:
[![Intercept](https://cagov.github.io/covid19.ca.gov-site-eng-playbook/content/images/intercept-ig.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9iE6mOs2OE&feature=emb_logo) |  ![Interviews](https://cagov.github.io/covid19.ca.gov-site-eng-playbook/content/images/interviews.jpg)  |  [![Usability](https://cagov.github.io/covid19.ca.gov-site-eng-playbook/content/images/usability.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SdM15B0X2_A&feature=emb_logo)


### Industry Guidance Recruitment criteria 
Some of our recruitment criteria were:

- A diverse set of visitors: business owners, goverment employees, members of the public, business associations.
- Business owners from a diverse set of industries and diverse buisness size.
- Users with a different frequency of visits.
- Live amd work in California.


### Industry Guidance outputs and deliverables

- We put together a report with a summary of the key takeaways and pain points. We also included videos and links to more information. 
- We segmented the visitors in three groups and delivered detailed information for each segment. These groups enabled the team to define what to prioritize next.

Business owners           |  Government officials          |  Members of the public         |    
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------: |:-------------------------:
![Business owmers](https://cagov.github.io/covid19.ca.gov-site-eng-playbook/content/images/business.jpg)  |  ![Government officials](https://cagov.github.io/covid19.ca.gov-site-eng-playbook/content/images/government.jpg) | ![Public](https://cagov.github.io/covid19.ca.gov-site-eng-playbook/content/images/public.jpg)

Our core visitor is the **county and city official** because: 

- they visit industry page multiple times a week.
- they refer others to the state website.
- they use the page in detail.
- content is key to the execution of their job.
- information and content is copied and cascaded to county websites.

Our secondary audience is the **business owner**. They:

- visit industry page when moving to new tier or after the governor's briefing.
- get most of the information from the accordions.
- get advice from county officials and business alliances on specifics when definitions such as ”with modifications” are unclear or state and county roles are conflicting.

![Engagement](https://cagov.github.io/covid19.ca.gov-site-eng-playbook/content/images/engagement.jpg)


- We also put together a spreadsheet with key findings and recommendations for the team to prioritize.

- This is a snapshot of the spreadsheet with key findings:

| Section 	| Findings 	| Recommendations 	| User Segment 	|
|-	|-	|-	|-	|
| Navigation (from Blueprint) 	| When visiting directly from the blueprint page, essential business can’t find any additional information and assume there are no restrictions. 	| Content: Consider adding essential business in the list of activities. 	| All of the users 	|
|  	| In the Blueprint page, the link to the industry guidance gets lost in the results. 	| Design: Consider making the link more relevant. 	| All of the users 	|
|  	| When coming to the industry guidance from results in the blueprint, visitors expect to see a detailed explanation of “with modifications” means. 	| Content: Consider adding a clarification of what “modifications” stand for. 	| All of the users 	|
|  	| If the result doesn’t provide guidance, there is no easy access to the industry guidance page. 	| Content: Consider adding a link to the Industry guidance page in the results so visitors can still find the page. 	| All of the users 	|
| Navigation (from Homepage) 	| The language from the homepage to access industry guidance page is confusing 	| Design: Consider creating a link to access the industry guidance from homepage that is consistent with the title of the page. 	| Business owners 	|
|  	| The different routes to access the industry guidance page are inconsistent:<br>what’s open, county status, How can I safely open my business. Industry guidance (footer) menu -> working safely -> Industry guidance 	| Design: Consider adding a section addressing business needs on the homepage. 	| Business owners 	|
|  	| When coming from the homepage, the visitor has no information about tiers. Which tier are we now? 	| Design: Consider adding or replicating the what’s open search in the industry guidance for people coming directly or from homepage. 	| All of the users 	|


- We also delivered a content gap analysis to discover “gaps” in addressing visitors' needs with the existing content:

| User segment 	| User need 	| Does content exist? 	| Can they find it and use it? 	|
|-	|-	|-	|-	|
| City officials 	| I want to know what are the new updated guidances 	| Yes 	| Sometimes 	|
| City officials 	| I want to know what is different from state and county guidances to make better judgments when informing the residents & businesses 	| No 	| No 	|
| City officials 	| I want to know what has changed in the new guidance so I can update our website with the new content. 	| Yes 	| Sometimes 	|
| Business owners 	| I want to know what category my business falls under. 	| Sometimes 	| Sometimes 	|
| Business owners 	| I want to find the right guidance that applies to the different parts of my business. For example: I own a hotel that also has a pool and restaurant. 	| Sometimes 	| Sometimes 	|
| Business owners 	| I want to find best practices to keep my employees and customers safe. For example, how often do we need to test? Do we need to do contract tracing? 	| Sometimes 	| No 	|
| Business owners 	| I want to know how my business will be affected if we move tiers so I can be prepared. 	| Sometimes 	| Sometimes 	|
| Business owners 	| I want to know who is in charge of regulations, guidances, enforcement, etc 	| No 	| No 	|
| Consumers 	| I want to fact check information regarding how businesses are following regulations in my county so I can decide what to do. 	| Yes 	| Sometimes 	|
| Consumers 	| I want to have the latest information about which activities are allowed in my county. 	| Yes 	| Sometimes 	|

### Industry Guidance Impact

- The post-launch feedback user research, and analysis of data identified some gaps and opportunities in both the industry guidance page and how it intersects with the blueprint Framework.

- The team decided that the best solution was an updated blueprint page design that incorporates industry guidance in a unified context. This solution addresses most of existing problems, streamlines the experience, and makes industry guidance easier to update, maintain and track.


| Prioritized Challenges 	| Solution 	| Success Metric 	|
|-	|-	|-	|
| Industry Guidance difficult to find (“find the guidance I’m interested in faster”). Users had to go through list manually  	| Add all industries to What’s open search (e.g., Agriculture, Cohorts, Manufacturing, Communications, Public transit, Mining, etc.). 	| Reduction in complaints re difficulty in finding guidance. 	|
| Users had to know the precise industry category term to find the relevant guidance. 	| Search and display of results now distinguish activities (such as Yoga) from Industry Categories (such as Gyms & Fitness Centers), so users no longer need to specify the exact term to find the relevant guidance, and specify precisely that “activity-name must follow guidance for industry-name.” 	| Reduction in complaints along the lines of “I searched yoga but you showed me gyms”. 	|
| Business users have not always realized that they may need to take heed of guidances from related industries. 	| The What’s Open search results for a given industry now also cite other industry guidances that might also be relevant, for example a gym might also have a cafe so this possibility is highlighted. 	| Metric to benchmark and track to see if goal gets achieved? 	|
| Site search is driving a larger than anticipated general public audience to the Industry Guidance page. 	| Incorporation of Industry Guidance information into the Blueprint context serves all audiences without increasing complexity.  	| Reduction in requests for support from general public users trying to make sense of the dedicated IG page. 	|
| Only 14% open PDFs, and it’s hard to see what part of a PDF was updated even if you do open it. 	| Guidance and Checklist PDFs are presented in context for the relevant industry without requiring a separate effort to find. 	| Hard to compare without an IG landing page, but the percentage of people who open PDFs after expanding the details of a search result should go up, as should the overall percentage of visitors who open PDFs. Target should be 2x to start. 	|
| Guidance depends on what tier your county is in but the IG page isn’t context-aware about what tier your county is in. 	| Because the Industry Guidance content is displayed as part of What’s Open search results the specified county’s tier is shown in the same context. 	| Reduction in complaints that tier information is lacking from Guidance PDFs. 	|
| Some users want to anticipate what the guidance will be if the tier changes. 	| The user can see the information for all tiers by leaving out the county information or by searching on a county that is in another tier. 	| Metric to benchmark and track to see if goal gets achieved? 	|
| Users seeking industry guidance are not always aware that there may be related county guidance that goes beyond the state mandates. 	| The new design is more intentional about the language to make this clear, and offers links to relevant county websites. 	| Metric to benchmark and track to see if goal gets achieved? 	|

The lead designer prototyped the proposed solution which still relies on communicating information through PDFs, but it also incorporates the value of the “Search Results”. Now a user can find their industry guidance through the search features and also get information about their tier in context. Two of the unmet needs uncovered during the resesarch process.

### Industry Guidance Reflections

What went well:
- With the merge of the industry guidance and the blueprint page we are improving the publication flow which helps the stakeholders with their day to day work.
- We have a created a more collaborative workflow with stakeholders than what we had.


Challenges:
- We know that only 14% of visitors open the PDF but we are redesigning the page with PDFs as the core piece. We are redesigning the page to make the guidance and checklist PDFs presented in context for the relevant industry without requiring a separate effort to find but we are taking a big risk that can lead to a lower user satisfaction if we don't do a great job since data is showing low open rate for PDFs with current page.

### Blueprint Context
On August 28th, 2020, the Governor’s office announced a new reopening framework for business sectors. This is a new state criteria for reopening businesses. More “prescriptive / dynamic criteria” based on local health officials and experience gained from the past months. 
As part of the administration’s focus on the reopening, we designed a new page to communicate this new framework and want to test it with business owners and members of the public to evaluate people's understanding  of the framework and test the usability of the page to get the message out.  

### Blueprint Timeline:
Overall, the project took a total of 5 weeks.

- Designing the research: 1 week
- Recruitment: 1 week
- Conducting research: 1 week
- Analysis: 1 week
- Report: 1 week

### Blueprint Research goals: 
- Evaluate the understanding of the new framework.
- Assess the user experience of the page.

### Blueprint Objectives:

- Identify difficulties and roadblocks participants experience when using the Blueprint page.
- Understand what participants are thinking and feeling as they execute tasks / prompts.
- Assess if the framework delivers a clear understanding of what businesses and individuals can do and why.
- Identify what new information needs to be provided.
- Align the new redesign and framework to people’s ability and understanding about what’s safe in their county.

### Blueprint Research methodology:
- We performed 10 usability testing sessions with members of the public and business owners to uncover problems and points of confusion when reviewing the blueprint page and assessing the understanding of the new framework.

### Blueprint Recruitment criteria:
Some of our recruitment criteria were:

- Members of the public with and without kids.
- Business owners in different industries, business sizes, various income brackets and counties in California.
- Age: 18-65+
- Geography: California.
- Language: English.
- Devices: mobile and desktop.

We used the following tools for recruitment:
- Usertesting.com

### Blueprint Usability script:

1. Briefly share how COVID-19 has impacted you and your family.
2. Have you heard about the new framework California is using to manage restrictions in counties? 
3. Have you been to this page before? First, read through the page and tell us what would you want to know about activities?
4. Choose an activity/business and find information about it in your county. Tell us what you think about the results.  Was anything confusing? Anything missing? 
5. Now, look at the County risk level graphic. What do you think about the levels/tiers? Are the labels/names meaningful? Why do you feel that way? What about the colors? How would you describe each level/tier in your own words?
What do you want to know about your county? Now, scroll down to the map. Search for your county. What information stands out? What’s next? What is useful about the map? What is confusing?
6. Now, find Tehama county. Do you understand why Tehama is in purple/widespread risk level? If so, explain why it is in this tier.
7. Based on the information on this page, can you explain how a county moves forward or backward to another level/tier?
8. After reviewing this page, do you think it helps people know what’s safe, what’s not, and how this system works? 


### Blueprint Analysis and synthesis:
We syntehsized each usability testing session after reviewing the videos. We took notes directly into a google document and then coded the data about tasks into a spreadsheet. We also used this opportunity to highlight relevant quotes. 

![Homepage](https://cagov.github.io/covid19.ca.gov-site-eng-playbook/content/images/coding-blueprint.jpg)


### Blueprint Outputs and deliverables
- We put together a report. In this report, we summarized the key takeaways and pain points we were finding. In this report, we also included videos and links to more information.

- This is a snapshot of some findings around usability and user experience:

|   Sections 	| UX 	| Usability 	|   	|
|-	|-	|-	|-	|
| <br>   Status of activity 	| It’s  nice to have. Participants tend to find out about what’s open and closed at the local/business level by searching Yelp/Google. <br>Activities need further clarification. Some participants are confused by what the reach and meaning of activity is: is it about going to the beach or a business type? 	| Intuitive and easy to use. Some usability issues were uncovered (non-existent businesses create some friction.  Results on mobile present some delivery issues - see slide 20) 	|   	|
|    Tiers 	| Labels are self-explanatory and meaningful. Widespread purple is not meaningful.<br>Case rate and positive rate are clear but some participants expect to see the real number for their counties.  	|  Easy to read and navigate. 	|   	|
|   Map 	| Desirable and memorable. New information. Great piece to create awareness. 	| Non intuitive on mobile. (friction regarding searchability and clickability) 	|   	|

10. [Links to documents](#health-equity-links-to-documents)

### Health Equity Context
The Equity page goal is to elevate the disparities in covid-19 so they can be focused on and addressed. This is part of a greater initiative to spur counties to demonstrate that they’re using their funding to support the communities most impacted.

### Health Equity Research goals:
We soft-launched the equity page to elevate these disparities. We wanted to take an opportunity to learn more about the visitors’ familiarity with the Health equity topic and assess their understanding of the data visualizations.

### Health Equity Research objective:

- Understand our visitors ability and familiarity with the topic. 
- Assess the visitors' understanding of the data visualizations.
- Assess the usability of the page.


### Health Equity Research questions:
- Who visits this page?
- What do they expect to find on this page?
- How do they navigate the page?
- What core message do they get out of the page? 
- What sections are relevant to each audience?
- How do they understand and explain the content of the data visualizations?


### Health Equity Research methodology
For this project, we decided on two different methods:

- Intercepted 87 visitors and learnt from their experience as they navigate the page.
- Performed 5 usability testing sessions with people with diverse background and familiarity with the topic of health equity.

### Health Equity Recruitment criteria

Some of our recruitment criteria were:

- Different familiarity and background.
- Different profficiency in the use of technology.

We used the following tools for recruitment:

- Ethnio intercepts.
- Friends & family for usability testing sessions.

### Health Equity Sample questions

Ethnio intercept questions:

1. Why did you visit California's commitment to health equity page?

- How familiar are you with the issue of health equity?
- Not at all familiar
- Somewhat familiar
- Very familiar

2. Based on what you’ve read, what do you take away from this page?

3. Is there other information you want to see on this page?
- No
- Yes (we’d like to know what it is)

4. What do you intend to do with this information? (Select all that apply.)
- Share it with colleagues and friends
- Read more about health and equity
- Digest it and come back later
- Contact a community based organization to collaborate with them
- Contact my local officials to learn more about what’s being done in my county and/or city
- Not much else
- Other (if you’d like to share, feel free) 

5. Which best describes you?
- I work for a city or county government 
- I am policymaker with a city or county government
- I'm a member of the public
- I work for a data provider (like a health system or a lab)
- I’m a member of the press
- Other

6. With which community do you identify? (This question is optional and you can select as apply)
- White
- Black or African American
- American Indian or Alaska Native
- Asian
- Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander
- Hispanic or Latino
- Another community

### Health Equity Analysis and synthesis
We reviewed the data from the intercepts and the usability testing sessions and created a word document and presentation with the findings from both methods. We also created a spreadsheet with findings, hyphotesis and recommendations. 

![Equity](https://cagov.github.io/covid19.ca.gov-site-eng-playbook/content/images/equity.jpg)

- We have identified two segments of users with different prior knowledge, abilities and overall expectations.

1. For the people who are familiar with the topic, this page is a great attempt but it falls short. This group is looking for more data that they could use to perform their own analysis.   
2. For people who are not very familiar with the issue, this page is quite sophisticated and it’s almost too advanced. The first two sections seem enough for a first attempt to learn about the issue and a great introduction to inequalities around race and ethnicity. This group is looking for more educational resources and a guided experience. 

![Equity](https://cagov.github.io/covid19.ca.gov-site-eng-playbook/content/images/segments.jpg)

### Health Equity Next steps

There are two possible approaches to our segmented audience:

1. Design for all: by presenting the same exact information in different ways we will provide different perspectives in understanding and interpreting information. This approach will satisfy the needs of audiences with different prior knowledge and experiences. It means meeting people where they are. 
2. Design for one specific audience by delivering information intentionally to satisfy those specific needs. 

- For our next steps, we recommend that we decide if we strive to make information understandable for all audiences and, evaluate **understandability** for each audience and iterate until it reaches an acceptable level of understanding. 
- In the short term, we can make raw data accessible to people who are interested in using it for their own research. This will not only empower these users but also strenghthen our approach towards transparency in government.
