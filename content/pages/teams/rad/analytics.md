## Overview

The analytics team provides data and reporting in support of the content team, research and design team, and external stakeholders. There are a few automated reports built to help these stakeholders above identify trends and changes in user behavior on the site. Some adhoc analyses that have been instrumental in providing recommendations are outlined below. 

## Google Analytics
Google Analytics is used statewide to roll up all agency reporting xyz. We use Google Analytics for xyz. 
Reporting
There are two analytics views we use for reporting.
- [Alpha Covid since launch (view id 207831940)](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/#/report/visitors-overview/a154336791w217797366p207831940/)
- [Covid19.ca.gov (view id 214378494)](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/#/report/visitors-overview/a154336791w217797366p214378494)

For historical reporting, we must combine data from both views. For the Alpha view, we start with the date range of 3/18/2020 and end on 3/24/2020. Then we combine that data with data from the covid19 view starting on 3/25/2020.

## Data Studio

There are three automated dashboards/reports:
- [COVID-19 Website Daily Report](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/0a380d5d-2087-4c68-adf5-b461545fd4a0/page/jailB)
- [COVID-19 content analytics dashboard](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/4dc7f0ec-9b4c-403a-8d16-82909a204760/page/7klnB)
- [Vaccines Page & MyTurn Analytics Report](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/aaac767a-5144-438c-825e-ba283c03986f/page/eL8xB)

The COVID-19 Website Daily Report has two pages that get updated, one gets updated daily with website changes that are live and in progress and the other page gets updated weekly with the top ten call center questions and a summary of survey feedback. This report gets sent out to COVID-19 team members and external stakeholders (vendors, GO) automatically Monday - Friday around 8 pm pst. 

The COVID-19 content analytics dashboard gets automatically sent to members of the content team to keep a pulse on site content, internal searches, and accordion clicks every Monday at 8 am pst.

The Vaccines Page & MyTurn Analytics Report gets automatically sent to a few COVID-19 team members and external stakeholders (Accenture, Blue Shield, CDPH) Mondays at 7 am pst.
