## Overview

Design on covid19.ca.gov collaborates with research, content, product and engigneering teams to visualize and prototype website updates.

### Custom page designs
Design helps conceptualize and prototype new pages or features that can not be created by the content team in Wordpress (i.e. anything that would require engineering support). This ensures that the team can explore a range of ideas, test with users, and collect stakeholder feedback before investing in engineering resources. Examples of custom page designs include the Health [Equity Dashboard](https://covid19.ca.gov/equity/), [State Dashboard](https://covid19.ca.gov/state-dashboard/), and [Blueprint page](https://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy).

### Custom visual assets and page components
Design helps create unique visual assets that support the Content Team in their ability to present information. Examples include the overview of vaccine phases on the [Vaccine page](https://staging.covid19.ca.gov/vaccines/) or the visual assets on the [Contact Tracing page](https://covid19.ca.gov/contact-tracing/).

### Design system and documentation 
Design maintains a library of styles and components to ensure a consistent user experience and efficient use of resources by leveraging existing components when possible. The design teams maintains this in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/LrzsOu8U5KcMAjJTQ1O3BG/covid19.ca.gov-screens?node-id=63%3A17). Engineering has similar documentation in [Storybook](https://wonderful-plant-07a82e81e.azurestaticapps.net/?path=/story/welcome--page).

### Content Feedback and Collaboration 
Design provides feedback and guidance on page designs led by the content team. These are often pages that do not require engineering support and be created by the content team in Wordpress. Examples of these include the [Restrictions page](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/) and the [Holidays page](https://covid19.ca.gov/holidays/).

### Research support 
Design collaborates on research by helping think through research approaches, creating prototypes and translating findings into approaches for new designs.
