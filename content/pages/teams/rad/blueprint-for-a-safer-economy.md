### Blueprint Context
On August 28th, 2020, the Governor’s office announced a new reopening framework for business sectors. This is a new state criteria for reopening businesses. More “prescriptive / dynamic criteria” based on local health officials and experience gained from the past months. 
As part of the administration’s focus on the reopening, we designed a new page to communicate this new framework and want to test it with business owners and members of the public to evaluate people's understanding  of the framework and test the usability of the page to get the message out.  

### Blueprint Timeline:
Overall, the project took a total of 5 weeks.

- Designing the research: 1 week
- Recruitment: 1 week
- Conducting research: 1 week
- Analysis: 1 week
- Report: 1 week

### Blueprint Research goals: 
- Evaluate the understanding of the new framework.
- Assess the user experience of the page.

### Blueprint Objectives:

- Identify difficulties and roadblocks participants experience when using the Blueprint page.
- Understand what participants are thinking and feeling as they execute tasks / prompts.
- Assess if the framework delivers a clear understanding of what businesses and individuals can do and why.
- Identify what new information needs to be provided.
- Align the new redesign and framework to people’s ability and understanding about what’s safe in their county.

### Blueprint Research methodology:
- We performed 10 usability testing sessions with members of the public and business owners to uncover problems and points of confusion when reviewing the blueprint page and assessing the understanding of the new framework.

### Blueprint Recruitment criteria:
Some of our recruitment criteria were:

- Members of the public with and without kids.
- Business owners in different industries, business sizes, various income brackets and counties in California.
- Age: 18-65+
- Geography: California.
- Language: English.
- Devices: mobile and desktop.

We used the following tools for recruitment:
- Usertesting.com

### Blueprint Usability script:

1. Briefly share how COVID-19 has impacted you and your family.
2. Have you heard about the new framework California is using to manage restrictions in counties? 
3. Have you been to this page before? First, read through the page and tell us what would you want to know about activities?
4. Choose an activity/business and find information about it in your county. Tell us what you think about the results.  Was anything confusing? Anything missing? 
5. Now, look at the County risk level graphic. What do you think about the levels/tiers? Are the labels/names meaningful? Why do you feel that way? What about the colors? How would you describe each level/tier in your own words?
What do you want to know about your county? Now, scroll down to the map. Search for your county. What information stands out? What’s next? What is useful about the map? What is confusing?
6. Now, find Tehama county. Do you understand why Tehama is in purple/widespread risk level? If so, explain why it is in this tier.
7. Based on the information on this page, can you explain how a county moves forward or backward to another level/tier?
8. After reviewing this page, do you think it helps people know what’s safe, what’s not, and how this system works? 


### Blueprint Analysis and synthesis:
We syntehsized each usability testing session after reviewing the videos. We took notes directly into a google document and then coded the data about tasks into a spreadsheet. We also used this opportunity to highlight relevant quotes.

### Blueprint Outputs and deliverables
- We put together a report. In this report, we summarized the key takeaways and pain points we were finding. In this report, we also included videos and links to more information.

- This is a snapshot of some findings around usability and user experience:

|   Sections 	| UX 	| Usability 	|   	|
|-	|-	|-	|-	|
| <br>   Status of activity 	| It’s  nice to have. Participants tend to find out about what’s open and closed at the local/business level by searching Yelp/Google. <br>Activities need further clarification. Some participants are confused by what the reach and meaning of activity is: is it about going to the beach or a business type? 	| Intuitive and easy to use. Some usability issues were uncovered (non-existent businesses create some friction.  Results on mobile present some delivery issues - see slide 20) 	|   	|
|    Tiers 	| Labels are self-explanatory and meaningful. Widespread purple is not meaningful.<br>Case rate and positive rate are clear but some participants expect to see the real number for their counties.  	|  Easy to read and navigate. 	|   	|
|   Map 	| Desirable and memorable. New information. Great piece to create awareness. 	| Non intuitive on mobile. (friction regarding searchability and clickability) 	|   	|

### Blueprint Impact

This research informed the team about the visitors' points of confusion around the framework and issues around the usability of the page. We proposed changes in the content hierarchy that were taken into consideration and implemented in newer iterations of the page.
