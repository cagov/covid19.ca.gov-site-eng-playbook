## Introducing UX Research at covid19.ca.gov

## What are the research goals?
- Our primary goal is to listen and engage with the public to address their needs and improve their overall journey when performing their tasks. 
- Research has informed product decisions by either framing the problem we are trying to solve or testing assumptions and hypotheses we previously had. 

## What methodologies have we used?
We have used quantitative and qualitative techniques and tools to actively and systematically engage with the public.
We have used surveys on specific topics, feedback on site, intercepts to gather data from our existing visitors, call center referrals, usability testing sessions and interviews amongst other techniques. 

## When do we do research?
In general the trigger for research starts with: 
1. the **product manager** request to better understand the visitors for a specific page. 
2. the **internal team** desire to further explore needs uncovered by exisiting data collection sources such as surveys or google analytics.
3. the request from an **external stakeholder** to further explore a topic or a group.
