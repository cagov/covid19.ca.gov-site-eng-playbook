## Overview
Research informs product decisions by either framing the problem we are trying to solve or testing assumptions and hypotheses we previously have. 
At ODI (Office of Digital Innovation)  we have used quantitative and qualitative methods and tools to actively and systematically engage with the public.

## Primary audience
1. Another research team taking over the  [covid19.ca.gov](covid19.ca.gov)
2. Other web teams within CA state that might be interested in certain specific aspects of our internal how-toâ€™s (e.g., if they want to understand how to use or set up their own intercept).

## Objectives for the documentation
Our documented research process will help the reader:
1. learn from existing processes and tools
2. identify gaps in the approaches
3. inform priorities and allocate new resources
4. gain context on the research that has been previously done
