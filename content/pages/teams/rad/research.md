## Overview
Research informs product decisions by either framing the problem we are trying to solve or testing assumptions and hypotheses we previously have. 
At ODI (Office of Digital Innovation)  we have used quantitative and qualitative methods and tools to actively and systematically engage with the public.

## Primary audience
1. Another research team taking over the covid19.ca.gov
2. Other web teams within CA state that might be interested in certain specific aspects of our internal how-to’s (e.g., if they want to understand how to use or set up their own intercept).

## Objectives for the documentation
Our documented research process will help the reader:
1. learn from existing processes and tools
2. identify gaps in the approaches
3. inform priorities and allocate new resources

# Project Based Research
Research activities undertaken to carry out the research of a diverse set of projects.


## Call Center
- **Purpose**: reach out to harder to reach previously identified groups such as Spanish speaking population who represent a higher % of the total population in California and have been highly impacted by covid-19. 
- **Method**: interviews via call center referrals
- **Tools**:  phone, spreadsheet
- **Setup and steps**: 

| **Steps** 	| **Process** 	| **Tools** 	| **Improvements** 	| **Roles and team at covid19** 	|
|-	|-	|-	|-	|-	|
| Meet with call center coordinator 	| One time meeting with coordinator to define desired flow 	| Spreadsheet, slack and email 	| This is a pretty straightforward process 	| Anne Descalzo (coordinator) and Clara Gonzalez Sueyro (researcher) 	|
| Define screener  	| Email sent to the coordinator and then forward to the call center operators.   	| Email 	| Evaluating a direct contact with operators 	| Researcher and coordinator 	|
| Ask call center operators to complete a spreadsheet 	| The operator needs to complete a spreadsheet with screener questions.<br>This seems to be a time consuming process for the call center operators, specially when dealing with high number of incoming calls 	| Spreadsheet 	| Redirect the phone call to the researcher. The researcher will have to put time on hold in case phone calls are redirected.  	| Call center operators (Maximus) 	|
| Share with researcher participants information 	| The call center shares every week a list of names with phone numbers and some demographic information. <br>Oftentimes the contact information is not enough to make an informed decision about best candidates in terms of recruiting a diverse pool. <br>Call center operators don’t ask for a lot of demographic information.  	| Spreadsheet 	| With the new flow, the operator will use his/her/they own judgment to redirect participants that have a lot to share 	| Call center operator (Maximus) 	|
| Send text message to participants to request to choose a time and date to be interviewed 	| Most scheduling tools that are free do ask for email addresses which not everyone that calls the call center have or they have a lot of advertising which undermines the trustworthiness of the process. 	| Scheduling tools: calendly, doodle 	| By having someone redirecting in real time phone calls to the researcher we avoid the struggles and pain points around the scheduling tools. 	| Researcher 	|
| Send reminder 	| Some tools require you to have the paid version to access this feature.  	| Text 	| No need to do that with new flow. 	| Researcher 	|
| Perform interview 	| A 30 minute interview is performed  	| Phone 	|  	| Researcher 	|
| Pay incentive 	| Once the interview is finished the participant will receive a $20 gift card sent from ethnio software tool. One big pain point is due to the way our credit card is set up our chief of administration (Debra Waltman)  needs to call ethnio every time a payment is sent.   	| Ethnio 	| If ethnio is something we want to keep using we could add money to the platform and we will not have to call after every transaction. 	| Chief of Administration 	|



## Ethnio Intercepts

- **Purpose**: gather feedback from existing visitors we were unable to reach out with other tools such as usertesting.com. Circumstances matter a lot in user research, and someone who’s using the website in real timer, for real purposes, is going to behave differently–and probably more accurate feedback–than someone who’s just being told to accomplish some task via usertesting.com
- **Method**: intercept visitors to learn from our existing user base. 
- **Tools**: [ethnio](https://ethn.io)
- **Setup and steps**: 


| Steps 	| Process 	| Tools 	| Improvements 	| Roles and team at covid19 	|
|-	|-	|-	|-	|-	|
| Get or renew a subscription 	| Pay a subscription. 	| ethnio 	| We were able to get additional features for free due to the nature of our work. 	| Chief of Administration<br>(Debra) 	|
| Onboard and assign seats 	| Debra needs to manually add or reassign seats  	| ethnio 	|  	| Debra 	|
| Design study 	| Create a script and screener or duplicate an existing one and change name 	| screener 	|  	| Researcher 	|
| Define recruitment method: intercept, link or native app intercept.  	| If choosing an intercept the researcher needs to share the javascript code with the engineer team to add to the desired page. <br>If choosing a link there is no need to share.  	| javascript code 	| Every time an intercept is turned off it is ideal to request the team to remove the line of javascript. Not only is in favor of accessibility practices but also it consumes pageviews which we have a limited amount per billing cycle.  	| Researcher 	|
| Turn intercept on 	| There is an on-off switch in the dashboard next to each screener. 	| ethnio 	|  	| Researcher 	|
| Download responses and create a report 	| Download all responses to: XLSX or CSV or XML. There is also a pdf option with predetermined graphs for some questions.  	| ethnio/ export data 	|  	| Researcher 	|

**Example of an intercept**

## Usability Testing

- **Purpose**: perform usability testing sessions with intended audiences to evaluate the performance of newly launched pages to evaluate the user experience and uncover usability issues
- **Method**: get people to interact with the page and observe their behavior when performing a specific task
- **Tools**: [usertesting.com](https://www.usertesting.com/)
- **Setup and steps**: 

| Steps 	| Process 	| Tools 	| Improvements 	|
|-	|-	|-	|-	|
| Get or renew subscription 	| Pay subscription. 	| usertesting.com 	| Chief of Administration<br>(Debra) 	|
| Assign seats 	| Negotiate the numbers of tests and seats 	| usertesting.com 	| Debra 	|
| Define goals and desired outcomes for a specific test 	| Create a script and screener or duplicate an existing one and change name.<br>Define number of participants. 	| usertesting.com 	| Researcher, content designer and ux designer 	|
| Create report and share findings 	| Usertesting records videos and can help create clips. There is a manual process to view videos and incorporate findings in a report 	| PPT/ usertesting.com 	| Researcher 	|

# Ongoing Feedback collection & Research
Ongoing activities undertaken to carry out the collection of feedback from our visitors or intended audience.  


## Per Page Feedback
- **Purpose**: capture user feedback at a per page level in order to better understand what pages are useful and how we can improve them. Review the iteration process to satisfy the initial goal. 
- **Method**: native form with additional information collected from a link we host on ethn.io
- **Tools**: [sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vFK8Xw41JThyJUa6M0Lv4qvAoJ-TQ4VK-TUc82FVFZA/edit#gid=1414096076)
 and [github](https://cagov.github.io/)
- **Setup and steps**: 

| Steps 	| Process 	| Tools 	| Improvements 	| Team 	|
|-	|-	|-	|-	|-	|
| Export feedback data and import in system 	| The data goes into Azure Cosmos DB (a cross region, managed database). We have a little webpage with a few web components on it in this repo https://github.com/cagov/comment-reports that hits the cosmos db api and pulls out the data with query params - (@Aaron) 	| Simple graph views based on our APIs hosted on github pages 	|  	| Aaron Hans (engineer) 	|
| Review data 	| Public facing: access data searchable by date, content captain and url<br>Every captain reviews their pages<br>Researcher reviews homepage  	| Access data here 	|  	| Content captains 	|
| Download data from ethnio links 	| Additional information is collected with an ethnio link: download data from surveys on a weekly basis 	| Ethnio + spreadsheet 	| If we had the enterprise subscription we could use the API and create an automatic download.  	| Data analyst (Britt Allen) 	|
| Import data to spreadsheet 	| We created a template to visualize the data from ethnio  	| Spreadsheet 	|  	| Britt (data analyst) 	|
| Share template with team 	| Every week we share the dashboard + themes and findings from previous week  	| Spreadsheet + slack 	|  	| Researcher and data analyst 	|


**Example of our feature**

![Per page feedback](https://cagov.github.io/covid19.ca.gov-site-eng-playbook/content/images/per-page.jpg)


## NPI Survey

- **Purpose**: gather longitudinal data from visitors to covid19.ca.gov and ca.gov to discover how attitudes and behaviors change as influenced by changes in policy, local and/or state economy, etc
- **Approach**: link display to every 50th visitor on covid19.ca.gov (homepage) and static link in ca.gov (homepage)
- **Tools**:  surveymonkey
- **Setup and steps**: 


| Steps 	| Process 	| Tools 	| Improvements 	| Team 	|
|-	|-	|-	|-	|-	|
| Design survey 	| The insights team designed the first version early on in March. Most questions remain the same to gather longitudinal data.  <br>Have to work with the eng team if we want to make changes to the way and frequency of delivery. Currently delivering to every 50th visitor on covid19.ca.gov and a static link on ca.gov site 	| Google docs Surveymonkey 	|  	| Insights team (JP, Jeffrey)<br>Researcher 	|
| Meet weekly 	| The insights team and some external volunteers meet on a weekly basis to discuss results and future iterations 	| Google meets 	|  	| Insights team, researcher , volunteers 	|
| Dump data daily on spreadsheet 	| Every weekday morning, Karim (content designer) downloads SurveyMonkey data from the NPI survey from the previous day from 12:00 am to 11:59 pm and then uploads it to the NPI raw data sheet with a new date 	| NPI raw data sheet 	|  	| Karim (anyone with access to surveymonkey) 	|
| Review of open ended questions to gather quotes 	| JP from Insights team will review open ended questions to gather quotes for the GO book.  Criteria to choose quotes: it’s really balancing themes that are constant, frequently mentioned, new ones that feel like we want to surface them, as well as edge cases that feel like we should shed light on 	|  	| Opportunity to follow up with interviews with participants who opted to provide email. Since 11/1 we collect emails but haven’t done much with it. 	| Insights team, content designer 	|

## UX Auditing


- **Purpose**:  identify common pain points across key user flows 
- **Method**: UX Audit where the internal team mapped out the entire user flow to get a clear picture of all the different pages and actions users take for specific tasks
- **Tools**:  miro, google docs, google slides, spreadsheet, quicktime
- **Setup and steps**: 


| Steps 	| Process 	| Tools 	|
|-	|-	|-	|
| Design study 	| A small team of one designer, one researcher and one data analyst met to design the study 	| Clara Gonzalez Sueyro (Researcher) and Adam Little ( designer) and Britt Allen (data analyst) 	|
| Create scenarios 	| Based on google analytics, GO office priorities and other feedback sources we created 10 scenarios 	| Britt Allen(Data analyst) 	|
| Assign scenarios 	| Each team member chose one or more scenarios to perform the audit 	| Britt, Clara, Adam and Jessica Lopez 	|
| Execute audit 	| Each team member identified the parts of the website that provided an answer to the user’s question in the scenario. 	| Britt, Clara, Adam and Jessica Lopez 	|
| Visualize audit 	| Each member created a map that showed all of the ways that a user might get there (including search). Each one chose to visualize the steps involved through a flow chart, mind map, or something similar. 	| Britt, Clara, Adam and Jessica Lopez 	|
| Uncover pain points 	| For each step in the flow, the team identified:<br>potential “pain points” that made the process difficult (e.g. confusing labeling) 	| Britt, Clara, Adam and Jessica Lopez 	|
| Find themes 	| As a group we synthesized pain points to determine themes/trends  	| Britt, Clara, Adam and Jessica Lopez 	|
| Define heuristics 	| Defined our own heuristics to reuse in future audits 	| Clara and Adam 	|
| Score scenarios 	| Scored each flow with the usability rubric 	|  	|
| Create list of quick wins and big improvements 	| For each theme, we created a list with small wins and big improvements<br>Small Wins: try to introduce them immediately. <br>Big Improvements:  large-scale improvements/problems that we would like to tackle in our next major redesign. 	| Clara and Adam 	|

# Sample Projects
Sample projects are the activities undertaken to carry out the research for specific pages & themes. 


## Homepage Iteration

### Intro
The main challenge / theme with this iteration of the homepage was “realignment”. Making sure that it serves the core purpose of the website, satisfying visitors needs and it is also aligned with the voice and brand of the CA COVID response.

### Research
1. Goals:
- Test with our audiences if the redesign is aligned with the websites core values and users needs
- Test the user experience of our audience when performing key tasks
- Test the look and feel of the new redesigned homepage

### Objectives of the study:
- Identify difficulties and roadblocks participants have when using the new homepage
- Understand what participants are thinking and feeling as they execute tasks / prompts

### Desired outcomes:
- Recommend changes to informational architecture and navigation
- Identify what new information needs to be collected to stimulate new learnings 

### Process:
- **Discover**: test homepage prototype with our audience
1. Discover → evaluative research → usability testing sessions
- **Define**: use research data and findings to identify opportunities for improvement
2. Define → summarize findings → uncover patterns within homepage predefined sections → propose recommendations for V1, V2

### Findings:

- **Dashboard** → **Updates**:
Uncertainty about the frequency of updates.
- **Hero section** → **Visibility**:
Some links present low visibility, specifically links on the dashboard.
- **Navigation** → **Discoverability**:
The hamburger navigation is not intuitive. 1 out of 10 participants discovered and clicked on the navigation. 
- **User needs** → **Relevance**:
Business owners find the homepage irrelevant to their needs. Page is perceived as consumer-driven.

| Section 	| Issue 	| Recommendations 	|  	|
|-	|-	|-	|-	|
| Tracking COVID-19 	| Uncertainty related to cases and deaths percentages [P2] 	| Consider adding a timeframe 	|  	|
|  	| Participants expressed doubts about the frequency of the updates. The data is 2 days old, participants question why isn’t it updated every hour or at least the day before. [Don't do] 	|  	|  	|
|  	| Participants also expressed doubts regarding the timeframe for the percentages. +0.7 up from last report?” yesterday? last week? last month? P1-clara, [Duplicate, B5] 	|  	|  	|
|  	| Confusion around number of tests: unique or total P1-Clara, [P1] 	| Consider adding a clarification 	|  	|
|  	| Cases and deaths are perceived as useless for business owners because they are not directly correlated to a business type/industry [Don't do] 	| Consider breaking cases by industry 	|  	|
|  	| People clicking the County map in Dashboard are redirected to status but are looking for a map. [P1] [P1] [P1--already have a ticket] 	| Make this link go directly to the map on the Blueprint page by A) an anchor link or B) moving the map to the top of the Blueprint page.<br>Alternatively, since the map is now on the State Dashboard, we could have a single link called "view all state and county data" 	|  	|
|  	| Tests are perceived as a metric that could be useful for business owners by increasing their confidence in reopening P2 [Don't do] 	| Consider providing information regarding test numbers per county 	|  	|

## Industry Guidance Redesign

### Intro
The industry guidance page is the fourth most visited page since May 2020. It has been a high priority for the Governor’s Office
and haven’t had a significant update since May 12. This page is key to the work of many stakeholders: city and county officials, business owners, business associations and members of the public. With new restrictions in place, this page becomes a go-to resource for many businesses and it was in need of a redesign.

### Research
1. Goals:
- Challenge existing assumptions by testing the usability and experience of the page with real visitors
- Understand how our visitors use the page 

### Objectives of the study:
- Understand why each, previously identified, segment would visit the industry guidance
- Understand how they navigate the page 
- Understand what they prioritize when checking the industry guidance page: what’s relevant and what’s not
- Understand when would they revisit the page and for what purpose: returning visitors

### Process:
1. Discover: interview stakeholders, perform user testing sessions and intercept visitors while performing a task
2. Define: use research data to identify opportunities for improvement.
-  summarize findings → uncover patterns and themes → create insights → content gap analysis → propose recommendations for MPV and V1


### Activities:
- **Intercept visitors** as they navigate the Industry guidance page to understand who they were and what they were trying to accomplish. 
- **Interview key stakeholders** such as GoBiz and business representatives to understand about their jobs and how do they use the page to serve their customers
- **Perform usability testing sessions** to evaluate our existing page in terms of usability and UX focusing on relevance, hierarchy and accessibility.

### Findings:

| Section 	| Issue 	| Recommendations 	| User Segment 	|
|-	|-	|-	|-	|
| Navigation (from Blueprint) 	| When visiting directly from the blueprint page, essential business can’t find any additional information and assume there are no restrictions. 	| Content: Consider adding essential business in the list of activities. 	| All of the users 	|
|  	| In the Blueprint page, the link to the industry guidance gets lost in the results. 	| Design: Consider making the link more relevant. 	| All of the users 	|
|  	| When coming to the industry guidance from results in the blueprint, visitors expect to see a detailed explanation of “with modifications” means. 	| Content: Consider adding a clarification of what “modifications” stand for. 	| All of the users 	|
|  	| If the result doesn’t provide guidance, there is no easy access to the industry guidance page. 	| Content: Consider adding a link to the Industry guidance page in the results so visitors can still find the page. 	| All of the users 	|
| Navigation (from Homepage) 	| The language from the homepage to access industry guidance page is confusing 	| Design: Consider creating a link to access the industry guidance from homepage that is consistent with the title of the page. 	| Business owners 	|
|  	| The different routes to access the industry guidance page are inconsistent:<br>what’s open, county status, How can I safely open my business. Industry guidance (footer) menu -> working safely -> Industry guidance 	| Design: Consider adding a section addressing business needs on the homepage. 	| Business owners 	|
|  	| When coming from the homepage, the visitor has no information about tiers. Which tier are we now? 	| Design: Consider adding or replicating the what’s open search in the industry guidance for people coming directly or from homepage. 	| All of the users 	|

### Themes --> Inisghts

**Theme: Format of content (i.e. overcoming constraints of PDFs)**
- Only 14% open a PDF. We know people are coming to better understand what modifications do they need to follow with the current or new guidance.
- Visitors can’t easily recognize which parts of the PDF have changed/ are updated.
- From an analytic and research perspective PDFs present a challenge: can’t track what people are doing
- Length
- Too many links that create friction and distraction
- Loading time
- Cookies
**Possible Approaches**
- Publish guidance in a database so that guidance can be accessed outside of a PDF and accessed by section (not a whole)
- Change structure or organization of PDFs to make them easier for users to skim
**Discussion Question**
- Are there opportunities to publish content outside of the PDF format?

**Theme: Hierarchy of content (i.e. making modifications more evident)**
- Since information inside accordions in a web page is the most important and relevant content, we want to add some key bullet points there for easy discoverability and accessibility.
- Most businesses and even consumers come to the site to check more about what “with modifications mean” and what things should businesses follow.
**Possible Approaches**
- Coordinate all of the “modifications” in one place/page
**Discussion Question**
- How can we better communicate modifications without opening a PDF or by linking to the right area?
- How can we use the same language (modifications) and clearly communicate what those activities are in the accordion?
- What is the argument for displaying content in the current way
- Can we put all modifications together? Can we address the section with the word modifications to be consistent with the language used in the Blueprint. 

**Theme: Recency of content (i.e. showing latest updates)**
- Visitors can’t easily recognize which parts of the PDF have changed/ are updated.
- Visitors that see their guidelines being dated, even when they have changed tiers, feel anxious. This undermines the mission of the site as a source of truth.
**Possible Approaches**
- Consider highlighting/commenting sections that have changed or consider adding a summary with current updates. This will help city officials when they have to summarize changes for the people in their counties.
- Consider adding a comment to remove friction: “this guidance is still current or in effect regardless the date”
**Discussion Question**
- Can we find a way to easily communicate those changes for visitors to easily recognize what has changed?

**Theme: Specificity of content (i.e. making it easier to get to industry-specific guidance)**
- Most relevant content is specific to their business and it is found inside the accordion
- The content in the Reopen your business section and Employer’s section is a nice to have but it’s not what drives visitors to this page
**Possible Approaches**
- Separate “general” content from industry-specific content so that users can more easily find what is unique to their industry
**Discussion Question**
- Is there a possibility to remove general content from PDF and put in the webpage so that PDFs are specific to each business?

### Content gap analysis

| User segment 	| User need 	| Does content exist? 	| Can they find it and use it? 	|
|-	|-	|-	|-	|
| City officials 	| I want to know what are the new updated guidances 	| Yes 	| Sometimes 	|
| City officials 	| I want to know what is different from state and county guidances to make better judgments when informing the residents & businesses 	| No 	| No 	|
| City officials 	| I want to know what has changed in the new guidance so I can update our website with the new content. 	| Yes 	| Sometimes 	|
| Business owners 	| I want to know what category my business falls under. 	| Sometimes 	| Sometimes 	|
| Business owners 	| I want to find the right guidance that applies to the different parts of my business. For example: I own a hotel that also has a pool and restaurant. 	| Sometimes 	| Sometimes 	|
| Business owners 	| I want to find best practices to keep my employees and customers safe. For example, how often do we need to test? Do we need to do contract tracing? 	| Sometimes 	| No 	|
| Business owners 	| I want to know how my business will be affected if we move tiers so I can be prepared. 	| Sometimes 	| Sometimes 	|
| Business owners 	| I want to know who is in charge of regulations, guidances, enforcement, etc 	| No 	| No 	|
| Consumers 	| I want to fact check information regarding how businesses are following regulations in my county so I can decide what to do. 	| Yes 	| Sometimes 	|
| Consumers 	| I want to have the latest information about which activities are allowed in my county. 	| Yes 	| Sometimes 	|

# Tips for Success (aka Lessons Learned)


1. Set time for generative/discovery research and exploratory data analysis that will help inform new avenues to satisfy unmet needs and unmet segments.
2. Visitors always ask for more than what they need. It is the team's decision to draw the line and find the balance between what people want and when and what is the right solution. Not sure this balance is clearly established within the team.
3. Spend time building systems and processes that can scale and become reusable. 
4. Clearly communicate with other stakeholders and agencies early on and include them in the process to avoid duplicated projects and strengthen buy- in from partners and fruitful collaborations.
