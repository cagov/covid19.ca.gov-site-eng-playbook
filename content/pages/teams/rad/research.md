## Why do we do research?
- Our primary goal is to listen and engage with the public to address their needs and improve their overall journey when performing their tasks. 
- Research has informed product decisions by either framing the problem we were trying to solve or testing assumptions and hypotheses we previously had. 

## What do we do?
We have used quantitative and qualitative techniques and tools to actively and systematically engage with the public.
We have used surveys on specific topics, feedback on site, intercepts, call center referals, usability testing, interviews amongst other techniques. 

## Who is this document for?
This was written for:
2. Other researchers working on the COVID-19 sites
3. Other web teams within CA state that might be interested in certain specific aspects of our internal how-toâ€™s (e.g., if they want to understand how to use or set up their own intercept).

##  Why is this document relevant?
Our objective is to ensure a researcher can feel comfortable with the tools and processes and apply them to a task at hand.
