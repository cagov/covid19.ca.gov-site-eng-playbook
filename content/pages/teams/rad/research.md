## Why do we research?
- Our primary goal is to listen and engage with the public to address their needs and improve their overall journey when performing their tasks. 
- Research has informed product decisions by either framing the problem we were trying to solve or testing assumptions and hypotheses we previously had. 

## How do we research?
We have used quantitative and qualitative techniques and tools to actively and systematically engage with the public.
We have used surveys on specific topics, feedback on site, intercepts, call center referals, usability testing, interviews amongst other techniques. 

## When do we research?
In general the trigger for research starts with: 
1. the product manager request to better understand the users of a specific page or a specific audience 
2. the desire to further explore groups or needs uncovered by exisiting data collection sources such as surveys or google analytics
3. the request from an external stakeholder

## Who is this documentation for?
This was prepared for:
2. Other researchers working on COVID-19 sites
3. Other web teams within CA state that might be interested in certain specific aspects of our internal how-toâ€™s (e.g., if they want to understand how to use or set up their own intercept).

##  Why this documentation?
Our objective is to ensure a researcher can feel comfortable with the tools and processes and apply them to a task at hand.

## What would you find in this documentation?
We organized the document in three categories of research. Each category describes the tool, the context of the tool and the kinds of problems/use cases we have used the tool for.

1.  Project based research: activities undertaken to carry out the research of a diverse set of projects.
2.  Ongoing research: activities undertaken to carry out the collection of feedback from our visitors 
3.  Sample projecs: activities undertaken to carry out the research for specific pages.
