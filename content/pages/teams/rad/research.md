Overview
Research informs product decisions by either framing the problem we are trying to solve or testing assumptions and hypotheses we previously have. 
At ODI we have used quantitative and qualitative methods and tools to actively and systematically engage with the public.

Process and Tools
Our documented research process will help the reader:
learn from existing approaches
identify gaps in the approaches
inform priorities and allocate new resources
