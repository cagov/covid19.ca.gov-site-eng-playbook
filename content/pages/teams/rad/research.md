## Overview
Research informs product decisions by either framing the problem we are trying to solve or testing assumptions and hypotheses we previously have. 
At ODI (Office of Digital Innovation)  we have used quantitative and qualitative methods and tools to actively and systematically engage with the public.

## Primary audience
1. Another research team taking over the covid19.ca.gov
2. Other web teams within CA state that might be interested in certain specific aspects of our internal how-to’s (e.g., if they want to understand how to use or set up their own intercept).

## Objectives for the documentation
Our documented research process will help the reader:
1. learn from existing processes and tools
2. identify gaps in the approaches
3. inform priorities and allocate new resources

# Project Based Research
Research activities undertaken to carry out the research of a diverse set of projects.


## Call Center
- **Purpose**: reach out to harder to reach previously identified groups such as Spanish speaking population who represent a higher % of the total population in California and have been highly impacted by covid-19. 
- **Method**: interviews via call center referrals
- **Tools**:  phone, spreadsheet
- **Setup and steps**: 

| **Steps** 	| **Process** 	| **Tools** 	| **Improvements** 	| **Roles and team at covid19** 	|
|-	|-	|-	|-	|-	|
| Meet with call center coordinator 	| One time meeting with coordinator to define desired flow 	| Spreadsheet, slack and email 	| This is a pretty straightforward process 	| Anne Descalzo (coordinator) and Clara Gonzalez Sueyro (researcher) 	|
| Define screener  	| Email sent to the coordinator and then forward to the call center operators.   	| Email 	| Evaluating a direct contact with operators 	| Researcher and coordinator 	|
| Ask call center operators to complete a spreadsheet 	| The operator needs to complete a spreadsheet with screener questions.<br>This seems to be a time consuming process for the call center operators, specially when dealing with high number of incoming calls 	| Spreadsheet 	| Redirect the phone call to the researcher. The researcher will have to put time on hold in case phone calls are redirected.  	| Call center operators (Maximus) 	|
| Share with researcher participants information 	| The call center shares every week a list of names with phone numbers and some demographic information. <br>Oftentimes the contact information is not enough to make an informed decision about best candidates in terms of recruiting a diverse pool. <br>Call center operators don’t ask for a lot of demographic information.  	| Spreadsheet 	| With the new flow, the operator will use his/her/they own judgment to redirect participants that have a lot to share 	| Call center operator (Maximus) 	|
| Send text message to participants to request to choose a time and date to be interviewed 	| Most scheduling tools that are free do ask for email addresses which not everyone that calls the call center have or they have a lot of advertising which undermines the trustworthiness of the process. 	| Scheduling tools: calendly, doodle 	| By having someone redirecting in real time phone calls to the researcher we avoid the struggles and pain points around the scheduling tools. 	| Researcher 	|
| Send reminder 	| Some tools require you to have the paid version to access this feature.  	| Text 	| No need to do that with new flow. 	| Researcher 	|
| Perform interview 	| A 30 minute interview is performed  	| Phone 	|  	| Researcher 	|
| Pay incentive 	| Once the interview is finished the participant will receive a $20 gift card sent from ethnio software tool. One big pain point is due to the way our credit card is set up our chief of administration (Debra Waltman)  needs to call ethnio every time a payment is sent.   	| Ethnio 	| If ethnio is something we want to keep using we could add money to the platform and we will not have to call after every transaction. 	| Chief of Administration 	|



## Ethnio Intercepts

- **Purpose**: gather feedback from existing visitors we were unable to reach out with other tools such as usertesting.com. Circumstances matter a lot in user research, and someone who’s using the website in real timer, for real purposes, is going to behave differently–and probably more accurate feedback–than someone who’s just being told to accomplish some task via usertesting.com
- **Method**: intercept visitors to learn from our existing user base. 
- **Tools**: [ethnio](https://ethn.io)
- **Setup and steps**: 


| Steps 	| Process 	| Tools 	| Improvements 	| Roles and team at covid19 	|
|-	|-	|-	|-	|-	|
| Get or renew a subscription 	| Pay a subscription. 	| ethnio 	| We were able to get additional features for free due to the nature of our work. 	| Chief of Administration<br>(Debra) 	|
| Onboard and assign seats 	| Debra needs to manually add or reassign seats  	| ethnio 	|  	| Debra 	|
| Design study 	| Create a script and screener or duplicate an existing one and change name 	| screener 	|  	| Researcher 	|
| Define recruitment method: intercept, link or native app intercept.  	| If choosing an intercept the researcher needs to share the javascript code with the engineer team to add to the desired page. <br>If choosing a link there is no need to share.  	| javascript code 	| Every time an intercept is turned off it is ideal to request the team to remove the line of javascript. Not only is in favor of accessibility practices but also it consumes pageviews which we have a limited amount per billing cycle.  	| Researcher 	|
| Turn intercept on 	| There is an on-off switch in the dashboard next to each screener. 	| ethnio 	|  	| Researcher 	|
| Download responses and create a report 	| Download all responses to: XLSX or CSV or XML. There is also a pdf option with predetermined graphs for some questions.  	| ethnio/ export data 	|  	| Researcher 	|

**Example of an intercept**

## Usability Testing

- **Purpose**: perform usability testing sessions with intended audiences to evaluate the performance of newly launched pages to evaluate the user experience and uncover usability issues
- **Method**: get people to interact with the page and observe their behavior when performing a specific task
- **Tools**: [usertesting.com](https://www.usertesting.com/)
- **Setup and steps**: 

| Steps 	| Process 	| Tools 	| Improvements 	|
|-	|-	|-	|-	|
| Get or renew subscription 	| Pay subscription. 	| usertesting.com 	| Chief of Administration<br>(Debra) 	|
| Assign seats 	| Negotiate the numbers of tests and seats 	| usertesting.com 	| Debra 	|
| Define goals and desired outcomes for a specific test 	| Create a script and screener or duplicate an existing one and change name.<br>Define number of participants. 	| usertesting.com 	| Researcher, content designer and ux designer 	|
| Create report and share findings 	| Usertesting records videos and can help create clips. There is a manual process to view videos and incorporate findings in a report 	| PPT/ usertesting.com 	| Researcher 	|

# Ongoing Feedback collection & Research
Ongoing activities undertaken to carry out the collection of feedback from our visitors or intended audience.  


## Per Page Feedback
- **Purpose**: capture user feedback at a per page level in order to better understand what pages are useful and how we can improve them. Review the iteration process to satisfy the initial goal. 
- **Method**: native form with additional information collected from a link we host on ethn.io
- **Tools**: [sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vFK8Xw41JThyJUa6M0Lv4qvAoJ-TQ4VK-TUc82FVFZA/edit#gid=1414096076)
 and [github](https://cagov.github.io/)
- **Setup and steps**: 

| Steps 	| Process 	| Tools 	| Improvements 	| Team 	|
|-	|-	|-	|-	|-	|
| Export feedback data and import in system 	| The data goes into Azure Cosmos DB (a cross region, managed database). We have a little webpage with a few web components on it in this repo https://github.com/cagov/comment-reports that hits the cosmos db api and pulls out the data with query params - (@Aaron) 	| Simple graph views based on our APIs hosted on github pages 	|  	| Aaron Hans (engineer) 	|
| Review data 	| Public facing: access data searchable by date, content captain and url<br>Every captain reviews their pages<br>Researcher reviews homepage  	| Access data here 	|  	| Content captains 	|
| Download data from ethnio links 	| Additional information is collected with an ethnio link: download data from surveys on a weekly basis 	| Ethnio + spreadsheet 	| If we had the enterprise subscription we could use the API and create an automatic download.  	| Data analyst (Britt Allen) 	|
| Import data to spreadsheet 	| We created a template to visualize the data from ethnio  	| Spreadsheet 	|  	| Britt (data analyst) 	|
| Share template with team 	| Every week we share the dashboard + themes and findings from previous week  	| Spreadsheet + slack 	|  	| Researcher and data analyst 	|


**Example of our feature**

## NPI Survey

- **Purpose**: gather longitudinal data from visitors to covid19.ca.gov and ca.gov to discover how attitudes and behaviors change as influenced by changes in policy, local and/or state economy, etc
- **Approach**: link display to every 50th visitor on covid19.ca.gov (homepage) and static link in ca.gov (homepage)
- **Tools**:  surveymonkey
- **Setup and steps**: 


| Steps 	| Process 	| Tools 	| Improvements 	| Team 	|
|-	|-	|-	|-	|-	|
| Design survey 	| The insights team designed the first version early on in March. Most questions remain the same to gather longitudinal data.  <br>Have to work with the eng team if we want to make changes to the way and frequency of delivery. Currently delivering to every 50th visitor on covid19.ca.gov and a static link on ca.gov site 	| Google docs Surveymonkey 	|  	| Insights team (JP, Jeffrey)<br>Researcher 	|
| Meet weekly 	| The insights team and some external volunteers meet on a weekly basis to discuss results and future iterations 	| Google meets 	|  	| Insights team, researcher , volunteers 	|
| Dump data daily on spreadsheet 	| Every weekday morning, Karim (content designer) downloads SurveyMonkey data from the NPI survey from the previous day from 12:00 am to 11:59 pm and then uploads it to the NPI raw data sheet with a new date 	| NPI raw data sheet 	|  	| Karim (anyone with access to surveymonkey) 	|
| Review of open ended questions to gather quotes 	| JP from Insights team will review open ended questions to gather quotes for the GO book.  Criteria to choose quotes: it’s really balancing themes that are constant, frequently mentioned, new ones that feel like we want to surface them, as well as edge cases that feel like we should shed light on 	|  	| Opportunity to follow up with interviews with participants who opted to provide email. Since 11/1 we collect emails but haven’t done much with it. 	| Insights team, content designer 	|

## Feedback Survey (Footer)

- **Purpose**: provide a place on the website for visitors to give general website feedback, suggestions and comments
- **Approach**: link on footer
- **Tools**:  SurveyMonkey
- **Setup and steps**:

| Steps 	| Process 	| Tools 	| Team 	|
|-	|-	|-	|-	|
| Design survey and/or edit questions 	| Over time we have made some edits to the questions to support and complement other sources of feedback  	| Google docs + surveymonkey 	| Researcher 	|
| Dump data daily 	| Karim downloads the data from SurveyMonkey and uploads it here. Karim reads through the feedback each morning 	| Spreadsheet 	| Karim (anyone with access to surveymonkey) 	|
| Review of comments daily 	| Share meaningful comments with the team, mostly via slack channel 	| Slack or standup 	| Karim or anyone reading the comments and feedback 	|

## UX Auditing


- **Purpose**:  identify common pain points across key user flows 
- **Method**: UX Audit where the internal team mapped out the entire user flow to get a clear picture of all the different pages and actions users take for specific tasks
- **Tools**:  miro, google docs, google slides, spreadsheet, quicktime
- **Setup and steps**: 


| Steps 	| Process 	| Tools 	|
|-	|-	|-	|
| Design study 	| A small team of one designer, one researcher and one data analyst met to design the study 	| Clara Gonzalez Sueyro (Researcher) and Adam Little ( designer) and Britt Allen (data analyst) 	|
| Create scenarios 	| Based on google analytics, GO office priorities and other feedback sources we created 10 scenarios 	| Britt Allen(Data analyst) 	|
| Assign scenarios 	| Each team member chose one or more scenarios to perform the audit 	| Britt, Clara, Adam and Jessica Lopez 	|
| Execute audit 	| Each team member identified the parts of the website that provided an answer to the user’s question in the scenario. 	| Britt, Clara, Adam and Jessica Lopez 	|
| Visualize audit 	| Each member created a map that showed all of the ways that a user might get there (including search). Each one chose to visualize the steps involved through a flow chart, mind map, or something similar. 	| Britt, Clara, Adam and Jessica Lopez 	|
| Uncover pain points 	| For each step in the flow, the team identified:<br>potential “pain points” that made the process difficult (e.g. confusing labeling) 	| Britt, Clara, Adam and Jessica Lopez 	|
| Find themes 	| As a group we synthesized pain points to determine themes/trends  	| Britt, Clara, Adam and Jessica Lopez 	|
| Define heuristics 	| Defined our own heuristics to reuse in future audits 	| Clara and Adam 	|
| Score scenarios 	| Scored each flow with the usability rubric 	|  	|
| Create list of quick wins and big improvements 	| For each theme, we created a list with small wins and big improvements<br>Small Wins: try to introduce them immediately. <br>Big Improvements:  large-scale improvements/problems that we would like to tackle in our next major redesign. 	| Clara and Adam 	|
