## Introducing UX Research at covid19.ca.gov

## What are the research goals?
- Our primary goal is to listen and engage with the public to address their needs and improve their overall journey when performing their tasks. 
- Research has informed product decisions by either framing the problem we were trying to solve or testing assumptions and hypotheses we previously had. 

## What methodologies have we used?
We have used quantitative and qualitative techniques and tools to actively and systematically engage with the public.
We have used surveys on specific topics, feedback on site, intercepts to gather data from our existing visitors, call center referrals, usability testing sessions and interviews amongst other techniques. 

## When do we do research?
In general the trigger for research starts with: 
1. the **product manager** request to better understand the visitors for a specific page. 
2. the **internal team** desire to further explore needs uncovered by exisiting data collection sources such as surveys or google analytics.
3. the request from an **external stakeholder** to further explore a topic or a group.

3. Other web teams within CA state that might be interested in certain specific aspects of our internal how-toâ€™s (e.g., if they want to understand how to use or set up their own intercept).

##  Why did we create this document?
Our objective is to ensure a researcher can feel comfortable with the tools and processes and apply them to a task at hand.

## What are you going to find?
We organized the document in three categories of research. 

1.  Project based research: activities undertaken to carry out the research of a **diverse set of projects**.
2.  Ongoing research: activities undertaken to carry out the collection of **feedback from our visitors** 
3.  Sample projecs: activities undertaken to carry out the research for **specific pages**.
