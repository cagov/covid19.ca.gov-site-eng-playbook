## Overview
The section describes the function of Research, Analytics and Design (affectionately known as Team RAD).

### Research
Research listens and engages with the public to address their needs and improve their overall journey when performing their tasks. Research informs product decisions by either framing the problem we are trying to solve or testing assumptions and hypotheses.

## Who is this section for?
Our objective is to ensure a researcher, analysts and designers can feel comfortable with the tools and processes we have used and apply them to a task at hand. This section is for:
1. Other researchers, analysts or designers working on COVID-19 sites.
2. Other web teams within CA state that might be interested in certain aspects of our internal how-toâ€™s (e.g., if they want to understand how to use or set up their own intercept).
