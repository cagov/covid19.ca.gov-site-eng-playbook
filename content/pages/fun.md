Changing how things get done in government is difficult. Doing it during a life-changing, history-altering event like the COVID-19 pandemic can be beyond stressful. With so much going on in maintaining covid19.ca.gov and our personal lives, things can get a little heavy.

That's why we take time in the day to create a supportive, fun culture that helps us deliver our best work for Californians.

## Appreciations

We created an entire Slack channel dedicated to thanking people for going above and beyond, significant accomplishments (like feature or page launches), or for just being a good person.

## The question of the day

At our morning standup meetings, we talk about what we're doing today and if anything's blocking our progress. We also add a little fun by throwing in a question (affectionately known as the **QOTD**). It's an opportunity to get to know the people you work with better.

Good standby questions include:

* What are you watching these days?
* What have you read recently?
* What was your favorite part of the past weekend?
* If you could travel anywhere tomorrow, where would you go?
* What's your wrong definition of a weird word (like pergola)?
* Making someone who usually crushes college team names at pub trivia name the one for everybody's alma mater

We also did months of themed questions in February for Black History Month and March for Women's History Month.

## Song of the day

At the end of the day we'd report on Slack about what we accomplished (sometimes including things still in progress or blocked). Some people used YouTube or Spotify to include a song they felt encapsulated their day, was something they'd listened to while working, or was just something they wanted to share.

Variations included:

* Smell of the day
* Thought of the day

## Unstructured check ins

When things move fast, it's easy to feel like you're in a silo. To combat this, some teams have standing meetings for the sole purpose of checking in with everyone. This helps people feel less alone and provide a space to voice if they're feeling overwhelmed. This time can also be used for general discussion. If the team does not have much to talk about, it provides protected time in their schedules.
