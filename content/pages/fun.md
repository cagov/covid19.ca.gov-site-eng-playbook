The COVID-19 pandemic has been a life-changing, history-altering event. With so much going on in maintaining covid19.ca.gov and our personal lives, things can sometimes get a little heavy. It helps to have a little bit of levity during the day.

## Appreciations

We created an entire Slack channel dedicated to thanking people for going above and beyond, significant accomplishments (like feature or page launches), or for just being a good person.

## The question of the day

At our morning standup meetings, we talk about what we're doing today and if anything's blocking our progress. We also add a little fun by throwing in a question (affectionately known as the **QOTD**). It's an opportunity to get to know the people you work with better.

Good standby questions include:

* What are you watching these days?
* What have you read recently?
* What was your favorite part of the past weekend?
* If you could travel anywhere tomorrow, where would you go?
* What's your wrong definition of a weird word (like pergola)?
* Making someone who usually crushes college team names at pub trivia name the one for everybody's alma mater

We also did months of themed questions in February for Black History Month and March for Women's History Month.

## Song of the day

At the end of the day we'd report on Slack about what we accomplished (sometimes including things still in progress or blocked). Some people used YouTube or Spotify to include a song they felt encapsulated their day, was something they'd listened to while working, or was just something they wanted to share.

Variations included:

* Smell of the day
* Thought of the day
